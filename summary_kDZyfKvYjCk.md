## 🎤 Key Insights from John Helmer (Russian Foreign Correspondent)  
### Arrival and Symbolism  
- Putin gave a two-thumbs-up walk toward Trump, signaling confidence and prior agreements from Russian sources.  
- Putin’s behavior demonstrated control and unreadiness to concede to the US, unlike Trump’s show of power.  
- Fighter jets on the red carpet were American, with markings painted over, signaling a strong US military posture.  

### What Was Agreed Behind Closed Doors  
- Russian sources reveal **Trump administration accepted Russia’s claims over Crimea and four southeastern Ukrainian oblasts**.  
- Agreement includes **no NATO membership for Ukraine** and **security guarantees involving demilitarization** of Ukraine from a Russian viewpoint.  
- Trump seeks a ceasefire to "get out of this war" without further US military engagement in Ukraine.  
- Russia expects Europeans and Ukrainian President Zelensky to agree to these terms, with Trump willing to step back if they do not.  

### Trump’s Position and Contradictions  
- Trump claimed many points agreed but no formal peace deal yet.  
- Stated he will consult NATO, European leaders, and Zelensky, appearing to defer final decision-making to them.  
- Seen as granting Zelensky and Europe a **veto power** over any agreement despite their current maximalist stance opposing Russia's terms.  
- Trump showed inconsistent statements on ceasefire and US involvement in Ukraine funding.

## 🔄 U.S., European, and Ukrainian Dynamics  
- The US is expected to stop funding Ukraine’s war directly but encourages Europeans to buy American weapons for Ukraine.  
- Secretary of Defense emphasizes division of labor: US shifts focus to China and other theaters, Europeans maintain Ukraine fight.  
- J.D. Vance's role is to negotiate with Europeans (especially UK) to align them with Trump-Putin deal and ensure Zelensky's compliance.  

### Ukrainian and European Stance  
- Zelensky maintains maximalist demands: no territorial concessions to Russia, full NATO membership for Ukraine, no lifting of sanctions on Russia.  
- European governments support Zelensky’s stance publicly but face political risks if forced to accept any deal.  
- Internal Ukrainian critics acknowledge no viable alternative leadership to Zelensky that would soften the stance.
