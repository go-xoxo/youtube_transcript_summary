Roman conquest because Judaism has

We can still prevent it and we can talk

88
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
We can still prevent it and we can talk
 

89
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,270
We can still prevent it and we can talk
later about how to prevent it. But we

90
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
later about how to prevent it. But we
 

91
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,710
later about how to prevent it. But we
should be clear about what we are facing

92
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
should be clear about what we are facing
 

93
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,589
should be clear about what we are facing
if if Israel continues on its present

94
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
if if Israel continues on its present
 

95

trajectory.

97
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,309
trajectory.
What we are facing is the potential of

98
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
What we are facing is the potential of
 

99
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,430
What we are facing is the potential of
an ethnic cleansing campaign in Gaza in

100
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
an ethnic cleansing campaign in Gaza in
 

101
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,270
an ethnic cleansing campaign in Gaza in
the West Bank resulting in the expulsion

But this will not be a military
 

155
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,509
But this will not be a military
catastrophe. The the state will actually

156
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
catastrophe. The the state will actually
 

157
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,630
catastrophe. The the state will actually

and it will make the challenge much much
 

163
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,710
and it will make the challenge much much
bigger. No Jew say in London or New York

00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
bigger. No Jew say in London or New York
 

165

or anywhere else will be able to say

166
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
or anywhere else will be able to say
 

167
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,390
or anywhere else will be able to say
this is not the real Judaism. It's like

168
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
this is not the real Judaism. It's like
 

169
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,550
this is not the real Judaism. It's like
being say a communist in the 1950s in in

170
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
being say a communist in the 1950s in in
 

171
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,949
being say a communist in the 1950s in in
London and saying no the Soviet Union is

172
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
London and saying no the Soviet Union is
 

173
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,270
London and saying no the Soviet Union is
not really communism. They misunderstood

174
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
not really communism. They misunderstood
 

175
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,470
not really communism. They misunderstood
it. No, this will be the new Judaism and

176
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
it. No, this will be the new Judaism and
 

177
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,670
it. No, this will be the new Judaism and
maybe the only Judaism.

178
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
maybe the only Judaism.
 

179
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,069
maybe the only Judaism.
Sorry.

180
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
Sorry.
 

181
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,349
Sorry.
No, there's so much to ask about what

182
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
No, there's so much to ask about what
 

183
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,870
No, there's so much to ask about what
you're saying, but what I'm wondering is

184
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
you're saying, but what I'm wondering is
 

185
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,749
you're saying, but what I'm wondering is
and and how to change that trajectory,

186
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
and and how to change that trajectory,
 

187
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,749
and and how to change that trajectory,
but when you look at the political map,

188
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
but when you look at the political map,
 

189
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,790
but when you look at the political map,
the extreme part of Israeli society is

190
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
the extreme part of Israeli society is
 

191
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,870
the extreme part of Israeli society is
actually a minority.

192
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
actually a minority.
 

193
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,510
actually a minority.
History is done by minorities. Most

194
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
History is done by minorities. Most
 

195
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,390
History is done by minorities. Most
people sit at home while history is

196
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
people sit at home while history is
 

197
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,110
people sit at home while history is
being done by five 10% of the

198
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
being done by five 10% of the
 

199
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,590
being done by five 10% of the
population. This has always been the

200
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
population. This has always been the
 

201
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,350
population. This has always been the
case.

202
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
case.
 

203
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,230
case.
And um I'm afraid that at least for some

204
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
And um I'm afraid that at least for some
 

205
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,550
And um I'm afraid that at least for some
of the things that I've mentioned, it's

206
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
of the things that I've mentioned, it's
 

207
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,390
of the things that I've mentioned, it's
not five or 10% of the Israeli

208
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
not five or 10% of the Israeli
 

209
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,310
not five or 10% of the Israeli
population. Like I was not surprised but

210
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
population. Like I was not surprised but
 

211
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,590
population. Like I was not surprised but
still shocked that when President Trump

212
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
still shocked that when President Trump
 

213
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,030
still shocked that when President Trump
suddenly put on the table the idea maybe

214
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,040
suddenly put on the table the idea maybe
 

215
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,870
suddenly put on the table the idea maybe
we just expel all the Palestinian from

216
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
we just expel all the Palestinian from
 

217
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,710
we just expel all the Palestinian from
Gaza.

218
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
Gaza.
 

219
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,749
Gaza.
A lot of Israelis, including people I

220
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
A lot of Israelis, including people I
 

221
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,510
A lot of Israelis, including people I
know personally,

222
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
know personally,
 

223
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,350
know personally,
who had these thoughts somewhere in the

224
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
who had these thoughts somewhere in the
 

225
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,590
who had these thoughts somewhere in the
back of the mind and always told

226
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
back of the mind and always told
 

227
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,830
back of the mind and always told
themselves, "You cannot say that and

228
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
themselves, "You cannot say that and
 

229
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,749
themselves, "You cannot say that and
it's pointless to say that because it's

230
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
it's pointless to say that because it's
 

231
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,629
it's pointless to say that because it's
unrealistic." The moment it came out of

232
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
unrealistic." The moment it came out of
 

233
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,270
unrealistic." The moment it came out of
the mouth of the US president, yes, we

234
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
the mouth of the US president, yes, we
 

235
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,110
the mouth of the US president, yes, we
can do that.

236
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
can do that.
 

237
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,510
can do that.
It was not five or 10% of the Israeli

238
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
It was not five or 10% of the Israeli
 

239
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,110
It was not five or 10% of the Israeli
population. Um, the support for these

240
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
population. Um, the support for these
 

241
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,430
population. Um, the support for these
kinds of things, I don't know the exact

242
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
kinds of things, I don't know the exact
 

243
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,310
kinds of things, I don't know the exact
numbers. But it could be even more than

244
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
numbers. But it could be even more than
 

245
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,110
numbers. But it could be even more than
50%.

246
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
50%.
 

247
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,110
50%.
But if you did the opposite and said

248
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
But if you did the opposite and said
 

249
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,790
But if you did the opposite and said
Palestinian state and you'll have Saudi

250
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
Palestinian state and you'll have Saudi
 

251
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,710
Palestinian state and you'll have Saudi
normalization, you don't think you'd

252
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
normalization, you don't think you'd
 

253
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,909
normalization, you don't think you'd
have a a strong support from the Israeli

254
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
have a a strong support from the Israeli
 

255
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,390
have a a strong support from the Israeli
public?

256
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
public?
 

257
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,029
public?
It's it's it still can. But again, it's

258
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
It's it's it still can. But again, it's
 

259
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,710
It's it's it still can. But again, it's
a question of what happens from now

260
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
a question of what happens from now
 

261
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,070
a question of what happens from now
onwards. But the possibility again of

262
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
onwards. But the possibility again of
 

263
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,110
onwards. But the possibility again of
ethnic cleansing and then undemocratic

264
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
ethnic cleansing and then undemocratic
 

265
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,350
ethnic cleansing and then undemocratic
Israel based on an ideology of Jewish

266
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
Israel based on an ideology of Jewish
 

267
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,990
Israel based on an ideology of Jewish
supremacy becoming the new reality. And

268
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
supremacy becoming the new reality. And
 

269
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,390
supremacy becoming the new reality. And
this is not a prophecy, but this is a

270
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
this is not a prophecy, but this is a
 

271
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,870
this is not a prophecy, but this is a
distinct possibility that we have to

272
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
distinct possibility that we have to
 

273
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,029
distinct possibility that we have to
really take into account. And the big

274
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
really take into account. And the big
 

275
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,629
really take into account. And the big
question that I would ask

276
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
question that I would ask
 

277
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,590
question that I would ask
is what are the values? What are the

278
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
is what are the values? What are the
 

279
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,430
is what are the values? What are the
ideals that Israel still stands for?

280
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
ideals that Israel still stands for?
 

281
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,670
ideals that Israel still stands for?
What positive ideals it still stands

282
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
What positive ideals it still stands
 

283
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,029
What positive ideals it still stands
for? Now, maybe I I'll I'll say

284
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
for? Now, maybe I I'll I'll say
 

285
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,350
for? Now, maybe I I'll I'll say
something. I I'll tell a story from

286
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
something. I I'll tell a story from
 

287
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,270
something. I I'll tell a story from
Jewish history that 2,000 years ago when

288
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
Jewish history that 2,000 years ago when
 

289
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,309
Jewish history that 2,000 years ago when
the Romans destroy the temple and

290
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
the Romans destroy the temple and
 

291
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,629
the Romans destroy the temple and
destroy Jerusalem,

292
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
destroy Jerusalem,
 

293
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,189
destroy Jerusalem,
Rabi Yohan Benzakai

294
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
Rabi Yohan Benzakai
 

295
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,790
Rabi Yohan Benzakai
asks the Roman commander, the Spasian,

296
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
asks the Roman commander, the Spasian,
 

297
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,710
asks the Roman commander, the Spasian,
for a favor. And he asks asks him, "Give

298
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
for a favor. And he asks asks him, "Give
 

299
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,550
for a favor. And he asks asks him, "Give
me the town of Yav and its wise people,

300
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
me the town of Yav and its wise people,
 

301
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,029
me the town of Yav and its wise people,
10 Yav."

302
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
10 Yav."
 

303
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,510
10 Yav."
And Vespasian agrees. He gives Benzakai

304
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
And Vespasian agrees. He gives Benzakai
 

305
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,990
And Vespasian agrees. He gives Benzakai
Yav where he establishes a center of

306
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
Yav where he establishes a center of
 

307
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,790
Yav where he establishes a center of
Jewish learning. And this is the the

308
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
Jewish learning. And this is the the
 

309
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,350
Jewish learning. And this is the the
previous big transformation in Jewish

310
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
previous big transformation in Jewish
 

311
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,309
previous big transformation in Jewish
history. You know, biblical Judaism and

312
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
history. You know, biblical Judaism and
 

313
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,670
history. You know, biblical Judaism and
second temple Judaism. It was a violent

314
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
second temple Judaism. It was a violent
 

315
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,150
second temple Judaism. It was a violent
tribal religion. The central rituals of

316
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
tribal religion. The central rituals of
 

317
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,150
tribal religion. The central rituals of
Judaism at that time were the bloody

318
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
Judaism at that time were the bloody
 

319
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,990
Judaism at that time were the bloody
rituals in the temple. It was a very

320
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
rituals in the temple. It was a very
 

321
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,150
rituals in the temple. It was a very
bloody religion.

322
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
bloody religion.
 

323
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,510
bloody religion.
And at that moment, Benzakai and his

324
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
And at that moment, Benzakai and his
 

325
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,309
And at that moment, Benzakai and his
colleagues, they completely change the

326
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
colleagues, they completely change the
 

327
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,469
colleagues, they completely change the
meaning of Judaism.

328
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
meaning of Judaism.
 

329
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,710
meaning of Judaism.
They turn it into a religion of

330
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
They turn it into a religion of
 

331
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,510
They turn it into a religion of
studying. This become the the the one

332
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
studying. This become the the the one
 

333
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,270
studying. This become the the the one
number one Jewish value is to study, to

334
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
number one Jewish value is to study, to
 

335
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,469
number one Jewish value is to study, to
learn, to debate, to develop wisdom.

336
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
learn, to debate, to develop wisdom.
 

337
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,510
learn, to debate, to develop wisdom.
Jews sit in Yavn and they learn. And

338
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
Jews sit in Yavn and they learn. And
 

339
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,230
Jews sit in Yavn and they learn. And
they go to Baghdad and Cairo and they

340
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
they go to Baghdad and Cairo and they
 

341
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,710
they go to Baghdad and Cairo and they
learn. and they go to Golders Green and

342
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
learn. and they go to Golders Green and
 

343
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,430
learn. and they go to Golders Green and
to Brooklyn and they learn. And for

344
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
to Brooklyn and they learn. And for
 

345
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,909
to Brooklyn and they learn. And for
2,000 years, this is what they do. We

346
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
2,000 years, this is what they do. We
 

347
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,510
2,000 years, this is what they do. We
do. We learn. And after 2,000 years,

348
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
do. We learn. And after 2,000 years,
 

349
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,830
do. We learn. And after 2,000 years,
Jews from all over the world come back

350
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
Jews from all over the world come back
 

351
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,629
Jews from all over the world come back
to Jerusalem to realize, to put into

352
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
to Jerusalem to realize, to put into
 

353
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,869
to Jerusalem to realize, to put into
practice what they have learned for

354
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
practice what they have learned for
 

355
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,309
practice what they have learned for
2,000 years.

356
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
2,000 years.
 

357
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,550
2,000 years.
And when I look at Israel now, I ask

358
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
And when I look at Israel now, I ask
 

359
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,869
And when I look at Israel now, I ask
myself, what did they learn in 2,000

360
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
myself, what did they learn in 2,000
 

361
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,150
myself, what did they learn in 2,000
years?

362
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
years?
 

363
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,710
years?
What the hell did they learn? They

364
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
What the hell did they learn? They
 

365
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,390
What the hell did they learn? They
learned to build a strong army.

366
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
learned to build a strong army.
 

367
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,629
learned to build a strong army.
Definitely. They learned to fight

368
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
Definitely. They learned to fight
 

369
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,589
Definitely. They learned to fight
courageously. Definitely. Some of them

370
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
courageously. Definitely. Some of them
 

371
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,790
courageously. Definitely. Some of them
learned the joy of crushing weaker

372
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
learned the joy of crushing weaker
 

373
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,749
learned the joy of crushing weaker
people under our feet. They learned

374
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
people under our feet. They learned
 

375
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,589
people under our feet. They learned
that. But all of these things, the

376
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
that. But all of these things, the
 

377
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,029
that. But all of these things, the
Romans knew them 2,000 years ago. So,

378
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
Romans knew them 2,000 years ago. So,
 

379
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,709
Romans knew them 2,000 years ago. So,
Benzakai made the wrong request.

380
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
Benzakai made the wrong request.
 

381
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,910
Benzakai made the wrong request.
Instead of wasting 2,000 years on

382
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
Instead of wasting 2,000 years on
 

383
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,070
Instead of wasting 2,000 years on
learning that you could have just asked

384
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
learning that you could have just asked
 

385
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,150
learning that you could have just asked
VPasian,

386
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
VPasian,
 

387
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,310
VPasian,
tell me

388
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
tell me
 

389
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,550
tell me
commander, how do you build a strong

390
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
commander, how do you build a strong
 

391
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,630
commander, how do you build a strong
army? Tell me you and your legionaries,

392
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
army? Tell me you and your legionaries,
 

393
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,790
army? Tell me you and your legionaries,
how you do you develop the the courage

394
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
how you do you develop the the courage
 

395
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,630
how you do you develop the the courage
to fight in war? And tell me about the

396
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
to fight in war? And tell me about the
 

397
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,590
to fight in war? And tell me about the
pleasure of crushing weaker people under

398
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
pleasure of crushing weaker people under
 

399
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,350
pleasure of crushing weaker people under
our feet. What was the point of 2,000

400
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
our feet. What was the point of 2,000
 

401
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,310
our feet. What was the point of 2,000
years of learning if the only thing we

402
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
years of learning if the only thing we
 

403
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,070
years of learning if the only thing we
learned is what the Romans already knew?

404
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
learned is what the Romans already knew?
 

405
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,790
learned is what the Romans already knew?
It's a waste of time. This scenario

406
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
It's a waste of time. This scenario
 

407
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,030
It's a waste of time. This scenario
you've

408
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040

 

409
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,509

that future scenario you you set out

410
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
that future scenario you you set out
 

411
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,910
that future scenario you you set out
which is a very bleak picture of a

412
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
which is a very bleak picture of a
 

413
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,630
which is a very bleak picture of a
different kind of

414
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
different kind of
 

415
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,710
different kind of
some of it is being realized as we

416
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
some of it is being realized as we
 

417
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,110
some of it is being realized as we
speak.

418
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
speak.
 

419
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,350
speak.
Sure. But what my first question to you

420
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
Sure. But what my first question to you
 

421
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,710
Sure. But what my first question to you
is where this sits in the sweep of

422
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
is where this sits in the sweep of
 

423
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,990
is where this sits in the sweep of
Jewish history and you've just given us

424
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
Jewish history and you've just given us
 

425
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,310
Jewish history and you've just given us
a very arresting sense of that with

426
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
a very arresting sense of that with
 

427
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,430
a very arresting sense of that with
these 2,000 wasted years. How much

428
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
these 2,000 wasted years. How much
 

429
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,829
these 2,000 wasted years. How much
though of what's going on now in Israel,

430
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
though of what's going on now in Israel,
 

431
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,829
though of what's going on now in Israel,
this particular government, the the the

432
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:49,839
this particular government, the the the
 

433
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,630
this particular government, the the the
formation it's taking fits actually with

434
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
formation it's taking fits actually with
 

435
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,870
formation it's taking fits actually with
some global trends that we can see

436
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
some global trends that we can see
 

437
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,710
some global trends that we can see
around us? In other words, that it's not

438
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
around us? In other words, that it's not
 

439
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,590
around us? In other words, that it's not
peculiarly Jewish, but is actually in

440
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
peculiarly Jewish, but is actually in
 

441
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,750
peculiarly Jewish, but is actually in
keeping with what we might see in Trump

442
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
keeping with what we might see in Trump
 

443
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,310
keeping with what we might see in Trump
or Orban or other places.

444
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
or Orban or other places.
 

445
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,430
or Orban or other places.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean one thing that should

446
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
Yeah. Yeah, I mean one thing that should
 

447
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,269
Yeah. Yeah, I mean one thing that should
be emphasized

448
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
be emphasized
 

449
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,550
be emphasized
um that there is nothing uniquely bad

450
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
um that there is nothing uniquely bad
 

451
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,949
um that there is nothing uniquely bad
about Israel. There is nothing uniquely

452
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
about Israel. There is nothing uniquely
 

453
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,550
about Israel. There is nothing uniquely
bad about what's happening now in Gaza.

454
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
bad about what's happening now in Gaza.
 

455
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,630
bad about what's happening now in Gaza.
We've seen it so many times in history

456
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
We've seen it so many times in history
 

457
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,430
We've seen it so many times in history
and we see it also today in different

458
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
and we see it also today in different
 

459
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,269
and we see it also today in different
areas around the world. And

460
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
areas around the world. And
 

461
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,430
areas around the world. And
certainly

462
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
certainly
 

463
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,990
certainly
what Israel is now undergoing both

464
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
what Israel is now undergoing both
 

465
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,310
what Israel is now undergoing both
internally in terms of the

466
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
internally in terms of the
 

467
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,630
internally in terms of the
disintegration of the democratic system

468
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
disintegration of the democratic system
 

469
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,110
disintegration of the democratic system
and also externally with the war, it is

470
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
and also externally with the war, it is
 

471
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,150
and also externally with the war, it is
part of much wider trends.

472
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
part of much wider trends.
 

473
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,350
part of much wider trends.
And certainly if we talk about the war,

474
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
And certainly if we talk about the war,
 

475
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,110
And certainly if we talk about the war,
it's part of the collapse of the global

476
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
it's part of the collapse of the global
 

477
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,829
it's part of the collapse of the global
liberal order which dominated most of

478
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
liberal order which dominated most of
 

479
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,190
liberal order which dominated most of
the world in recent decades and is now

480
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
the world in recent decades and is now
 

481
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,550
the world in recent decades and is now
being rapidly dismantle dismantled

483
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,630
being rapidly dismantle dismantled
uh first and foremost by the country

484
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
uh first and foremost by the country
 

485
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,470
uh first and foremost by the country
that created it in the first place, the

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
that created it in the first place, the
 

487
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,790
that created it in the first place, the
United States.

488
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
United States.
 

489
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,509
United States.
And again, it's it's a big subject, so

490
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
And again, it's it's a big subject, so
 

491
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,150
And again, it's it's a big subject, so
I'll focus on just one thing.

492
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
I'll focus on just one thing.
 

493
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,150
I'll focus on just one thing.
The most important taboo of the global

494
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
The most important taboo of the global
 

495
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,509
The most important taboo of the global
liberal order was that you cannot that

496
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
liberal order was that you cannot that
 

497
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,190
liberal order was that you cannot that
strong countries cannot just invade and

498
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
strong countries cannot just invade and
 

499
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,190
strong countries cannot just invade and
conquer other countries by force of arms

500
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
conquer other countries by force of arms
 

501
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,590
conquer other countries by force of arms
just because they are stronger.

502
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
just because they are stronger.
 

503
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,910
just because they are stronger.
This was the situation for thousands of

504
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
This was the situation for thousands of
 

505
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,350
This was the situation for thousands of
years. This is something that the Romans

506
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
years. This is something that the Romans
 

507
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,110
years. This is something that the Romans
did very very well and

508
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
did very very well and
 

509
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,829
did very very well and
it stopped being the situation

510
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
it stopped being the situation
 

511
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,790
it stopped being the situation
in the last few decades. It has been I

512
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
in the last few decades. It has been I
 

513
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,630
in the last few decades. It has been I
would say the most amazing political and

514
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
would say the most amazing political and
 

515
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,069
would say the most amazing political and
maybe moral achievement of humankind

516
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
maybe moral achievement of humankind
 

517
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,110
maybe moral achievement of humankind
and it's it was not a dream. It was a

518
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
and it's it was not a dream. It was a
 

519
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,230
and it's it was not a dream. It was a
reality and the place to see that it was

520
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
reality and the place to see that it was
 

521
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,230
reality and the place to see that it was
a reality is in government budgets.

522
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
a reality is in government budgets.
 

523
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,230
a reality is in government budgets.
You know, people talk about peace and

Don't read poetry. Read government
 

531
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,069
Don't read poetry. Read government
budgets.

most amazing thing to read because for
 

539
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,629

the Roman Empire was spent on soldiers,
 

545
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,590
the Roman Empire was spent on soldiers,
warships, fortresses, weapons. And this

warships, fortresses, weapons. And this
 

547
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,829
warships, fortresses, weapons. And this
was the situation until the 20th

was the situation until the 20th
 

549
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,150
was the situation until the 20th
century. You look at the budget not just

century. You look at the budget not just
 

551
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,870

of of empires also of democratic

than 50% is spent on the military. In
 

557
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,190
than 50% is spent on the military. In
the early 21st century the average

7%.
 

569
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,430
7%.
compared to 10% average spent on health

570
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
compared to 10% average spent on health
 

571
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,430
compared to 10% average spent on health
care. It was the first time in human

572
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
care. It was the first time in human
 

573
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,470
care. It was the first time in human
history that governments spent more

574
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
history that governments spent more
 

575
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,230
history that governments spent more
money on health care than on the

money on health care than on the
 

577

military.
 

579
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,030
military.
So it was a reality and it was all based

580
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
So it was a reality and it was all based
 

581
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,230
So it was a reality and it was all based
on this basic taboo that okay there are

582
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
on this basic taboo that okay there are
 

583
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,870
on this basic taboo that okay there are
civil wars, there are revolts,

584
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
civil wars, there are revolts,
 

585
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,470
civil wars, there are revolts,
revolutions, we didn't solve all

586
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
revolutions, we didn't solve all
 

587
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,910
revolutions, we didn't solve all
problems but one thing is off the table.

588
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
problems but one thing is off the table.
 

589
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,550
problems but one thing is off the table.
You cannot invade and conquer another

590
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
You cannot invade and conquer another
 

591
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,110
You cannot invade and conquer another
country just because you're stronger.

592
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
country just because you're stronger.
 

593
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,389
country just because you're stronger.
And this taboo has now been broken

594
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
And this taboo has now been broken
 

595
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,790
And this taboo has now been broken
most clearly by Putin with the invasion

596
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
most clearly by Putin with the invasion
 

597
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,230
most clearly by Putin with the invasion
of Ukraine.

598
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
of Ukraine.
 

599
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,829
of Ukraine.
But instead of trying to contain it and

600
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
But instead of trying to contain it and
 

601
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,430
But instead of trying to contain it and
to punish Russia for what it has done,

602
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
to punish Russia for what it has done,
 

603
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,790
to punish Russia for what it has done,
uh the current US administration

604
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
uh the current US administration
 

605
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,069
uh the current US administration
joined Russia in basically saying this

606
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079
joined Russia in basically saying this
 

607
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,870
joined Russia in basically saying this
is the new normal. It's no longer a

608
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
is the new normal. It's no longer a
 

609
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,990
is the new normal. It's no longer a
taboo. you can now do it. And for

610
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
taboo. you can now do it. And for
 

611
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,389
taboo. you can now do it. And for
instance, when President Trump says that

612
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
instance, when President Trump says that
 

613
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,310
instance, when President Trump says that
he has plans to annex Greenland and if

614
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
he has plans to annex Greenland and if
 

615

he has plans to annex Greenland and if
Denmark refuses to said to seed

Denmark refuses to said to seed
 

617

Denmark refuses to said to seed
Greenland, then all the options are on

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
Greenland, then all the options are on
 

619
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,910
Greenland, then all the options are on
the table, including the use of force,

620
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
the table, including the use of force,
 

621
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,509
the table, including the use of force,
you know that we are in a different

But it sounds like you don't think
 

735
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,150
But it sounds like you don't think
liberal democracy stands a chance in

736
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
liberal democracy stands a chance in
 

737
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,590
liberal democracy stands a chance in
this world.

738
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
this world.
 

739
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,189
this world.
Democracy is a different issue.

00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
Democracy is a different issue.
 

741
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,949
Democracy is a different issue.
Democracies sometimes have nuclear

742
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
Democracies sometimes have nuclear
 

743
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,829
Democracies sometimes have nuclear
weapons.

744
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
weapons.
 

745
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,429
weapons.
Democracies sometimes have very strong

00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
Democracies sometimes have very strong
 

747
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,669
Democracies sometimes have very strong
armies to defend themselves. It's there

748
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
armies to defend themselves. It's there

are two of course it it it has in
influences

752
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
influences
 

753
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,150
influences
but there is a conversation about the

754
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
but there is a conversation about the
 

755
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,069
but there is a conversation about the
survival of democratic systems. There is

756
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
survival of democratic systems. There is
 

757
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,750
survival of democratic systems. There is
a conversation about the survival of

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
a conversation about the survival of
 

759
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,150
a conversation about the survival of
international order. We shouldn't mix

760
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
international order. We shouldn't mix
 

761
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,029
international order. We shouldn't mix
the two together because the one of the

762
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
the two together because the one of the
 

763
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,150
the two together because the one of the
good things about the uh uh liberal

764
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
good things about the uh uh liberal
 

765
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,350
good things about the uh uh liberal
order of recent decades is that even

766
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
order of recent decades is that even
 

767
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,710
order of recent decades is that even
autocratic regimes were part of it. It

768
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
autocratic regimes were part of it. It
 

769
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,070
autocratic regimes were part of it. It
was not an order that was restricted to

770
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
was not an order that was restricted to
 

771
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,270
was not an order that was restricted to
democratic countries alone.

772
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
democratic countries alone.
 

773
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,310
democratic countries alone.
Um also countries like China they can be

774
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
Um also countries like China they can be
 

775
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,029
Um also countries like China they can be
part of this international rule of law

776
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
part of this international rule of law
 

777
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,789
part of this international rule of law
which again was the biggest taboo that

778
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
which again was the biggest taboo that
 

779
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,549
which again was the biggest taboo that
you can't invade and conquer other

780
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
you can't invade and conquer other
 

781
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,830
you can't invade and conquer other
countries without being democratic.

782
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
countries without being democratic.
 

783
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,750
countries without being democratic.
Um so it's it's it's two parallel u um

784
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
Um so it's it's it's two parallel u um
 

785
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,630
Um so it's it's it's two parallel u um
crisis that we are facing and we need to

786
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
crisis that we are facing and we need to
 

787
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,549
crisis that we are facing and we need to
make a distinction that we we don't need

788
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
make a distinction that we we don't need
 

789
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,150
make a distinction that we we don't need
all the countries in the world to be

790
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
all the countries in the world to be
 

791
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,870
all the countries in the world to be
democratic in order to maintain this

792
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
democratic in order to maintain this
 

793
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,350
democratic in order to maintain this
basic taboo.

794
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
basic taboo.
 

795
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,430
basic taboo.
We we've gone on and we we pushed you

796
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
We we've gone on and we we pushed you
 

797
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,870
We we've gone on and we we pushed you
there into the bigger picture of the

798
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
there into the bigger picture of the
 

799
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,110
there into the bigger picture of the
world. Just before we leave our

800
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
world. Just before we leave our
 

801
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,470
world. Just before we leave our
parochial particular concern about the

it's a thing that people say um about
other conflicts that the thing about

you know whether it's Northern Ireland

812
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
you know whether it's Northern Ireland
 

813
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,270
you know whether it's Northern Ireland
or South Africa, whatever it is that in

814
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
or South Africa, whatever it is that in
 

815
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,710
or South Africa, whatever it is that in
the end they end. Is that true? And if

816
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
the end they end. Is that true? And if
 

817
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,990
the end they end. Is that true? And if
it's not true, what makes the Israeli

818
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
it's not true, what makes the Israeli
 

819
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,950
it's not true, what makes the Israeli
Palestinian conflict exceptional? It's

820
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
Palestinian conflict exceptional? It's
 

821
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,150
Palestinian conflict exceptional? It's
not exceptional. I mean, it's

822
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
not exceptional. I mean, it's
 

823
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,669
not exceptional. I mean, it's
exceptional in the sense that every

824
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
exceptional in the sense that every
 

825
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,909
exceptional in the sense that every
conflict is is exceptional. There are

826
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
conflict is is exceptional. There are
 

827
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,950
conflict is is exceptional. There are
unique features for every conflict in in

828
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
unique features for every conflict in in
 

829
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,750
unique features for every conflict in in
the world. Uh the Israeli Palestinian

830
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760
the world. Uh the Israeli Palestinian
 

831
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,270
the world. Uh the Israeli Palestinian
conflict is not exceptionally brutal.

832
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
conflict is not exceptionally brutal.
 

833
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,630
conflict is not exceptionally brutal.
It's not exceptionally complicated. It's

834
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
It's not exceptionally complicated. It's
 

835
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,990
It's not exceptionally complicated. It's
not exceptionally long. If people say,

836
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
not exceptionally long. If people say,
 

837
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,230
not exceptionally long. If people say,
you know, every every conflict ends in

838
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
you know, every every conflict ends in
 

839
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,070
you know, every every conflict ends in
the end. So, I don't know, you mentioned

840
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
the end. So, I don't know, you mentioned
 

841
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,029
the end. So, I don't know, you mentioned
Ireland. How many centuries did it take?

842
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
Ireland. How many centuries did it take?
 

843
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,630
Ireland. How many centuries did it take?
I don't know when you start. It's always

844
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
I don't know when you start. It's always
 

845
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,150
I don't know when you start. It's always
the question when when you choose to

846
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
the question when when you choose to
 

847
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,070
the question when when you choose to
start it. But if you start, you know, in

848
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
start it. But if you start, you know, in
 

849
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,230
start it. But if you start, you know, in
in the 12th century with William

850
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
in the 12th century with William
 

851
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,270
in the 12th century with William
Strongbo and the Norman baronss coming

852
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
Strongbo and the Norman baronss coming
 

853
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,310
Strongbo and the Norman baronss coming
to Ireland. So it took what 800 years.

854
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
to Ireland. So it took what 800 years.
 

855
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,909
to Ireland. So it took what 800 years.
Israel is just, you know, it's just one

856
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
Israel is just, you know, it's just one
 

857
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,870
Israel is just, you know, it's just one
century. So by this calculation, it will

858
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
century. So by this calculation, it will
 

859
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,070
century. So by this calculation, it will
be going in in in in 2,600

860
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
be going in in in in 2,600
 

861
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,909
be going in in in in 2,600
when there are no longer any human

862
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
when there are no longer any human
 

863
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,669
when there are no longer any human
beings around. It's just AIS and

864
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
beings around. It's just AIS and
 

865
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,110
beings around. It's just AIS and
cyborgs.

866
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
cyborgs.
 

867
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,230
cyborgs.
We're going to get on to that.

868
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
We're going to get on to that.
 

869
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,590
We're going to get on to that.
I don't know if that's a scary thought

870
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
I don't know if that's a scary thought
 

871
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,549
I don't know if that's a scary thought
or not. Actually,

872
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
or not. Actually,
 

873
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,230
or not. Actually,
I was just thinking how full of cheer

874
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
I was just thinking how full of cheer
 

875
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,510
I was just thinking how full of cheer
you value. He's our He's our little ray

876
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
you value. He's our He's our little ray
 

877
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,270
you value. He's our He's our little ray
of sunshine that he's bringing here.

878
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
of sunshine that he's bringing here.
 

879
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,270
of sunshine that he's bringing here.
It It does help. It does help because I

880
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
It It does help. It does help because I
 

881
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,510
It It does help. It does help because I
I I have to tell you, yesterday I was at

882
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
I I have to tell you, yesterday I was at
 

883
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,950
I I have to tell you, yesterday I was at
a dinner party with very good friends

884
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
a dinner party with very good friends
 

885
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,510
a dinner party with very good friends
and there were two topics on the table.

886
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
and there were two topics on the table.
 

887
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,590
and there were two topics on the table.
One was the Middle East and the other

888
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
One was the Middle East and the other
 

889
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,590
One was the Middle East and the other
was AI. And the issue of AI was markedly

890
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
was AI. And the issue of AI was markedly
 

891
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,590
was AI. And the issue of AI was markedly
more depressing than the Middle East,

892
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
more depressing than the Middle East,
 

893
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,909
more depressing than the Middle East,
which I I found in a weird way a little

894
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919
which I I found in a weird way a little
 

895
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,470
which I I found in a weird way a little
bit reassuring because at the end of the

896
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
bit reassuring because at the end of the
 

897
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,029
bit reassuring because at the end of the
day, the Middle East is about what you

898
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
day, the Middle East is about what you
 

899
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,669
day, the Middle East is about what you
would call the carbon-based uh uh mind,

900
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
would call the carbon-based uh uh mind,
 

901
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,110
would call the carbon-based uh uh mind,
right? The decisions. It could be bad

902
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
right? The decisions. It could be bad
 

903
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,190
right? The decisions. It could be bad
decisions, good decisions, trajectories,

904
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
decisions, good decisions, trajectories,
 

905
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,669
decisions, good decisions, trajectories,
but it's still humans. An AI at some

906
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
but it's still humans. An AI at some
 

907
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,549
but it's still humans. An AI at some
point when it can refine itself, when we

908
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
point when it can refine itself, when we
 

909
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,630
point when it can refine itself, when we
hit the artificial global intelligence

910
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
hit the artificial global intelligence
 

911
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,430
hit the artificial global intelligence
or the artificial super intelligence, no

912
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,440
or the artificial super intelligence, no
 

913
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,310
or the artificial super intelligence, no
one honestly knows what is going to

914
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
one honestly knows what is going to
 

915
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,390
one honestly knows what is going to
happen. Not the designers, not anyone

916
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
happen. Not the designers, not anyone
 

917
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,190
happen. Not the designers, not anyone
else.

918
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
else.
 

919
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,070
else.
And I wonder when you what do you what

920
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080
And I wonder when you what do you what
 

921
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,909
And I wonder when you what do you what
would you even like this audience to

922
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
would you even like this audience to
 

923
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,789
would you even like this audience to
leave here with thinking about about

924
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
leave here with thinking about about
 

925
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,950
leave here with thinking about about
that about AI?

926
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
that about AI?
 

927
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,990
that about AI?
So again before we kind of rush to say

928
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
So again before we kind of rush to say
 

929
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,950
So again before we kind of rush to say
is it good is it bad you know utopian

Yeah.

954
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
Yeah.
 

955
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,950
Yeah.
AI is different because it's not a tool.

AI is different because it's not a tool.

AI is different because it's not a tool.
It is an agent. What is an agent? An

It is an agent. What is an agent? An
agent is something that can make

By definition, if you create an agent,

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
By definition, if you create an agent,
 

969
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,990
By definition, if you create an agent,
you cannot predict what it will do and

970
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
you cannot predict what it will do and
 

971
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,750
you cannot predict what it will do and
how it will behave.

972
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
how it will behave.
 

973
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,669
how it will behave.
If you create something which you know

If you create something which you know
 

975
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,110
If you create something which you know
in advance everything it will do, it is

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,789
in advance everything it will do, it is
not an AI. It could be automatic. We

not an AI. It could be automatic. We
have lots of automatic machines, coffee

and change and make decisions by itself.
Um, and we have no idea what will happen

988
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
Um, and we have no idea what will happen
 

989
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,710
Um, and we have no idea what will happen
when not just one AI appears.

audience actually because it was on
 

1051
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,630
audience actually because it was on
this. We asked all of you before you

1052
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
this. We asked all of you before you
 

1053
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,950
this. We asked all of you before you
came to send in questions to us and

1054
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
came to send in questions to us and
 

1055
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,830
came to send in questions to us and
we're going to get to most of them

we're going to get to most of them
 

1057
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,909
we're going to get to most of them
later, but one of them was directly on

intelligence is somehow connected to
 

1113
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,750
intelligence is somehow connected to
truth so a super intelligent AI I will

truth so a super intelligent AI I will
have a kind of super access to truth.

1116
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
have a kind of super access to truth.
 

1117
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,990
have a kind of super access to truth.
No, intelligence is not about truth.

1118
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
No, intelligence is not about truth.
 

1119
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,549
No, intelligence is not about truth.
Intelligence is the ability to solve

1120
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
Intelligence is the ability to solve
 

1121
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,390
Intelligence is the ability to solve
problems, to define goals and solve

1122
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
problems, to define goals and solve
 

1123
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,870
problems, to define goals and solve
problems on the way to the goal. The

1124
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
problems on the way to the goal. The
 

1125
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,470
problems on the way to the goal. The
truth is one of the things that can help

1126
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480
truth is one of the things that can help
 

1127
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,350
truth is one of the things that can help
you do that, but not the only one. And

1128
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
you do that, but not the only one. And
 

1129
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,549
you do that, but not the only one. And
we have seen with human beings that

1130
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
we have seen with human beings that
 

1131
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,630
we have seen with human beings that
human beings until today have been the

1132
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
human beings until today have been the
 

1133
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,470
human beings until today have been the
most intelligent animals entities on the

1134
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:44,480
most intelligent animals entities on the
 

1135
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,590
most intelligent animals entities on the
planet and at the same time we have also

1136
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
planet and at the same time we have also
 

1137
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,950
planet and at the same time we have also
been the most delusional entities on the

1138
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
been the most delusional entities on the
 

1139
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,190
been the most delusional entities on the
planet. We believe nonsensical things

1140
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
planet. We believe nonsensical things
 

1141
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,470
planet. We believe nonsensical things
that no chimpanzee and no dog and no

1142
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
that no chimpanzee and no dog and no
 

1143
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,430
that no chimpanzee and no dog and no
horse would ever believe.

1144
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440
horse would ever believe.
 

1145
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,430
horse would ever believe.
And a super intelligence is very likely

1146
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
And a super intelligence is very likely
 

1147
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,110
And a super intelligence is very likely
to be super delusional

1148
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
to be super delusional
 

1149
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,630
to be super delusional
even more deluded than we are.

1150
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:12,640
even more deluded than we are.
 

1151
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,430
even more deluded than we are.
So we would need again a very strong

1152
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,440
So we would need again a very strong
 

1153
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,830
So we would need again a very strong
ethical basis a very strong basis of

1154
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
ethical basis a very strong basis of
 

1155
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,950
ethical basis a very strong basis of
values more than even before because the

1156
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:22,960
values more than even before because the
 

1157
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,149
values more than even before because the
challenges are bigger.

1158
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:24,159
challenges are bigger.
 

1159
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,830
challenges are bigger.
Yeah. I mean a super intelligence is

1160
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
Yeah. I mean a super intelligence is
 

1161
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,750
Yeah. I mean a super intelligence is
more bound to build a super delusion is

1162
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
more bound to build a super delusion is
 

1163
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,149
more bound to build a super delusion is
something that we will be left with just

1164
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
something that we will be left with just
 

1165
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,950
something that we will be left with just
asking as a human are we going to lose

1166
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
asking as a human are we going to lose
 

1167
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,029
asking as a human are we going to lose
depending it depends on us

1168
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:35,039
depending it depends on us
 

1169
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:35,750
depending it depends on us
okay

1170
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
okay
 

1171
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,190
okay
and does it depend on us

1172
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
and does it depend on us
 

1173
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,310
and does it depend on us
history is a radically open-ended

1174
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
history is a radically open-ended
 

1175
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,669
history is a radically open-ended
process

1176
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
process
 

1177
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,390
process
you know you had dur for most of human

1178
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
you know you had dur for most of human
 

1179
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,549
you know you had dur for most of human
history humans had these two main

1180
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:46,559
history humans had these two main
 

1181
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,350
history humans had these two main
visions of history one of them is a

1182
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
visions of history one of them is a
 

1183
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,470
visions of history one of them is a
linear history progressing towards a

1184
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,480
linear history progressing towards a
 

1185
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,750
linear history progressing towards a
predetermined end that in the end the

1186
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
predetermined end that in the end the
 

1187
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,149
predetermined end that in the end the
Messiah would come in the end God will

1188
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,159
Messiah would come in the end God will
 

1189
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,870
Messiah would come in the end God will
do some miracle in the end whatever or

1190
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:00,880
do some miracle in the end whatever or
 

1191
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,549
do some miracle in the end whatever or
if you're a Marxist in the end the

1192
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
if you're a Marxist in the end the
 

1193
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,510
if you're a Marxist in the end the
revolution will come

1194
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
revolution will come
 

1195
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,710
revolution will come
or if you're here in the end an

1196
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
or if you're here in the end an
 

1197
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,510
or if you're here in the end an
intermission will come you know

1198
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,520
intermission will come you know
 

1199
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,830
intermission will come you know
yeah and then you had the cyclical model

1200
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:11,840
yeah and then you had the cyclical model
 

1201
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,230
yeah and then you had the cyclical model
that things just repeat themselves again

1202
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
that things just repeat themselves again
 

1203
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,110
that things just repeat themselves again
and again and again in the same cycle

1204
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
and again and again in the same cycle
 

1205
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,070
and again and again in the same cycle
and the truth is neither history is a

1206
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
and the truth is neither history is a
 

1207
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,909
and the truth is neither history is a
radically open-ended process

1208
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:23,919
radically open-ended process
 

1209
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,149
radically open-ended process
It doesn't repeat itself and it doesn't

1210
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
It doesn't repeat itself and it doesn't
 

1211
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,430
It doesn't repeat itself and it doesn't
go to a predetermined place. Right now,

1212
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
go to a predetermined place. Right now,
 

1213
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,830
go to a predetermined place. Right now,
it can it can go in radically different

1214
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:31,840
it can it can go in radically different
 

1215
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,390
it can it can go in radically different
ways with what's happening to democracy,

1216
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,400
ways with what's happening to democracy,
 

1217
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,669
ways with what's happening to democracy,
to the international order, with AI.

1218
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
to the international order, with AI.
 

1219
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,909
to the international order, with AI.
Um, and it depends on the choices we

1220
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
Um, and it depends on the choices we
 

1221
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,230
Um, and it depends on the choices we
make.

1222
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
make.
 

1223
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,669
make.
But hang on, you've just said it depends

1224
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
But hang on, you've just said it depends
 

1225
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,909
But hang on, you've just said it depends
on the choices we make. You've also told

1226
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:43,919
on the choices we make. You've also told
 

1227
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,470
on the choices we make. You've also told
us that AI has agency. So, it doesn't

1228
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
us that AI has agency. So, it doesn't
 

1229
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,750
us that AI has agency. So, it doesn't
depend only on the choices.

1230
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:47,760
depend only on the choices.
 

1231
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,590
depend only on the choices.
In five years, it will no longer depend

1232
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,600
In five years, it will no longer depend
 

1233
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,669
In five years, it will no longer depend
on us. in five years.

1234
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
on us. in five years.
 

1235
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,070
on us. in five years.
Yes. I mean, we'll still ma be making

1236
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
Yes. I mean, we'll still ma be making
 

1237
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,310
Yes. I mean, we'll still ma be making
big choices in five years, but in five

1238
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
big choices in five years, but in five
 

1239
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,870
big choices in five years, but in five
years, the AIs will also be making some

1240
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880
years, the AIs will also be making some
 

1241
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,630
years, the AIs will also be making some
of the most important choices in the

1242
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
of the most important choices in the
 

1243
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:00,950
of the most important choices in the
world,

1244
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
world,
 

1245
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,230
world,
and they'll be making those choices

1246
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240
and they'll be making those choices
 

1247
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,470
and they'll be making those choices
without recourse to us

1248
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,480
without recourse to us
 

1249
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,350
without recourse to us
increasingly. Yes. Again, think the best

1250
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
increasingly. Yes. Again, think the best
 

1251
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,590
increasingly. Yes. Again, think the best
example is the financial system. When

1252
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
example is the financial system. When
 

1253
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,269
example is the financial system. When
people think about the AI revolution,

1254
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
people think about the AI revolution,
 

1255
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,430
people think about the AI revolution,
they tend to imagine the Terminator

1256
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,440
they tend to imagine the Terminator
 

1257
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,950
they tend to imagine the Terminator
robots flying in the streets shooting

1258
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
robots flying in the streets shooting
 

1259
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,190
robots flying in the streets shooting
people. It's better to think about

1260
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200
people. It's better to think about
 

1261
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,909
people. It's better to think about
something like the 20078 financial

1262
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:19,919
something like the 20078 financial
 

1263
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,430
something like the 20078 financial
crisis

1264
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
crisis
 

1265
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,389
crisis
that finance is the ideal playing ground

1266
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:24,399
that finance is the ideal playing ground
 

1267
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,310
that finance is the ideal playing ground
for AI because it's a it's a

1268
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
for AI because it's a it's a
 

1269
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,950
for AI because it's a it's a
purelyformational realm. It's just data

1270
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
purelyformational realm. It's just data
 

1271
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,470
purelyformational realm. It's just data
in data out. You don't need a body in

1272
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480

million dollars and tell the AI just do
 

1283
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,950

Uh, you could have regulations against

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360
Uh, you could have regulations against
 

1315
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,990
Uh, you could have regulations against
it but the current US administration is

Yeah. And it was because some very

1340
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,320
Yeah. And it was because some very
 

1341
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,110
Yeah. And it was because some very
intelligent and very delusional humans

intelligent and very delusional humans
invented extremely complex financial

1344
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
invented extremely complex financial
 

1345
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,310
invented extremely complex financial
devices called CDOS's that almost nobody

1346
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,320
devices called CDOS's that almost nobody
 

1347
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,029
devices called CDOS's that almost nobody
understood and the regulators failed to

1348
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:13,039
understood and the regulators failed to
 

1349
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,190
understood and the regulators failed to
regulate for a couple of years. They

1350
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,200
regulate for a couple of years. They
 

1351
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,669
regulate for a couple of years. They
made billions and then everything

1352
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
made billions and then everything
 

1353
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,269
made billions and then everything
crashed. Now what if AIs invent new

1354
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:21,279
crashed. Now what if AIs invent new
 

1355
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,230
crashed. Now what if AIs invent new
financial devices that no human being on

earth understands for a couple of years
 

1359
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,350
earth understands for a couple of years
they make billions and trillions and

1360
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
they make billions and trillions and
 

1361
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,750
they make billions and trillions and
everybody's happy. Then there is a huge

1362
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:31,760
everybody's happy. Then there is a huge
 

1363
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,350
everybody's happy. Then there is a huge
huge crisis and you know they wake the

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,360
huge crisis and you know they wake the
 

1365
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,789
huge crisis and you know they wake the
president in the middle of the night and

president in the middle of the night and
 

1367
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,630
president in the middle of the night and
they tell him the financial system is in

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
they tell him the financial system is in
 

1369
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,230
they tell him the financial system is in
meltdown and nobody has any idea what is

1370
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
meltdown and nobody has any idea what is
 

1371
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,230
meltdown and nobody has any idea what is
happening because there is no human

happening because there is no human
 

1373
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,870
happening because there is no human
being on earth which is able to

being on earth which is able to
 

1375
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,830
being on earth which is able to
understand these new financial devices

1376
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:49,840
understand these new financial devices
 

1377
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,230
understand these new financial devices
that the AI invented. See, this is what

1378
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
that the AI invented. See, this is what
 

1379
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,750
that the AI invented. See, this is what
I mean. It's so scary. You want to go

1380
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
I mean. It's so scary. You want to go
 

1381
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,190
I mean. It's so scary. You want to go
back to talking about the Middle East,

1382
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,200
back to talking about the Middle East,
 

1383
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,950
back to talking about the Middle East,
but I mean I but let's try and and

1384
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
but I mean I but let's try and and
 

1385
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,950
but I mean I but let's try and and
breathe through this and how do you

1386
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:00,960
breathe through this and how do you
 

1387
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,350
breathe through this and how do you
prepare for a world and you you talked

1388
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
prepare for a world and you you talked
 

1389
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,029
prepare for a world and you you talked
about this. You said people are not only

1390
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
about this. You said people are not only
 

1391
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,350
about this. You said people are not only
going to be out of a job because of AI,

1392
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,360
going to be out of a job because of AI,
 

1393
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,430
going to be out of a job because of AI,
but they'll be unemployable because this

1394
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
but they'll be unemployable because this
 

1395
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,990
but they'll be unemployable because this
is an ever you called it this this um

1396
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,000
is an ever you called it this this um
 

1397
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,549
is an ever you called it this this um
revolution.

1398
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:12,559
revolution.
 

1399
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,389
revolution.
If you're in the financial sector and

1400
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:14,399
If you're in the financial sector and
 

1401
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,630
If you're in the financial sector and
you can no longer understand the

1402
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
you can no longer understand the
 

1403
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,710
you can no longer understand the
financial devices,

1404
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:18,720
financial devices,
 

1405
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,029
financial devices,
then

1406
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:19,039
then
 

1407
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,710
then
then you're unemployable. How do you

1408
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
then you're unemployable. How do you
 

1409
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,950
then you're unemployable. How do you
prepare your children, the next

1410
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960
prepare your children, the next
 

1411
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,870
prepare your children, the next
generation? How do you yourself prepare

1412
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:24,880
generation? How do you yourself prepare
 

1413
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,269
generation? How do you yourself prepare
for that kind of world?

1414
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
for that kind of world?
 

1415
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,750
for that kind of world?
The most important thing is to have a

1416
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
The most important thing is to have a
 

1417
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,190
The most important thing is to have a
very flexible mind because the one thing

1418
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
very flexible mind because the one thing
 

1419
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,310
very flexible mind because the one thing
we know for sure is that the pace of

1420
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,320
we know for sure is that the pace of
 

1421
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,190
we know for sure is that the pace of
change is only going to accelerate.

1422
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200
change is only going to accelerate.
 

1423
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,990
change is only going to accelerate.
Nobody has any idea how the financial

1424
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000
Nobody has any idea how the financial
 

1425
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,990
Nobody has any idea how the financial
system or the economic system would

1426
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000
system or the economic system would
 

1427
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,070
system or the economic system would
look, the job market would look like in

1428
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
look, the job market would look like in
 

1429
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,789
look, the job market would look like in
10 years or 15 years. So if you say okay

1430
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:48,799
10 years or 15 years. So if you say okay
 

1431
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,070
10 years or 15 years. So if you say okay
I'll teach my kids how to code computers

1432
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,080
I'll teach my kids how to code computers
 

1433
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,990
I'll teach my kids how to code computers
this is the computer age they should

1434
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
this is the computer age they should
 

1435
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,870
this is the computer age they should
learn how to code. No in five or 10

1436
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:56,880
learn how to code. No in five or 10
 

1437
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,710
learn how to code. No in five or 10
years maybe you don't need any human

1438
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
years maybe you don't need any human
 

1439
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,950
years maybe you don't need any human
coders because AI is doing all the

1440
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
coders because AI is doing all the
 

1441
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,310
coders because AI is doing all the
coding. Mhm.

1442
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,320
coding. Mhm.
 

1443
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,029
coding. Mhm.
So we don't know the the the reality is

1444
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
So we don't know the the the reality is
 

1445
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,190
So we don't know the the the reality is
we just don't know what will be the

1446
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,200
we just don't know what will be the
 

1447
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,149
we just don't know what will be the
skills people will need in 10 years

1448
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
skills people will need in 10 years
 

1449
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,470
skills people will need in 10 years
except for one. We know they will need

1450
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,480
except for one. We know they will need
 

1451
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,230
except for one. We know they will need
the skill to readjust and reinvent

1452
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
the skill to readjust and reinvent
 

1453
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,630
the skill to readjust and reinvent
themselves. And again this is a very

1454
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:20,640
themselves. And again this is a very
 

1455
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,549
themselves. And again this is a very
difficult mental skill. It's not

1456
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:22,559
difficult mental skill. It's not
 

1457
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,350
difficult mental skill. It's not
learning something that then remains

1458
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
learning something that then remains
 

1459
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,909
learning something that then remains
unchanged throughout your life. It's

1460
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:27,919
unchanged throughout your life. It's
 

1461
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,909
unchanged throughout your life. It's
learning how to keep learning all your

1462
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:29,919
learning how to keep learning all your
 

1463
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,389
learning how to keep learning all your
life. I want to go back to even an

1464
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,399
life. I want to go back to even an
 

1465
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,990
life. I want to go back to even an
earlier part of our talk which is my

1466
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,000
earlier part of our talk which is my
 

1467
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,909
earlier part of our talk which is my
introduction of you and I mentioned how

1468
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:35,919
introduction of you and I mentioned how
 

1469
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,470
introduction of you and I mentioned how
you are one of the best known Israelis

1470
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480
you are one of the best known Israelis
 

1471
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,029
you are one of the best known Israelis
in the world and just in our closing

1472
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:41,039
in the world and just in our closing
 

1473
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,470
in the world and just in our closing
minute or two.

1474
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
minute or two.
 

1475
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,549
minute or two.
Um what has that been like in this

1476
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:44,559
Um what has that been like in this
 

1477
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,149
Um what has that been like in this
period these 20 months we're talking

1478
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:46,159
period these 20 months we're talking
 

1479
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,990
period these 20 months we're talking
about to be famously an Israeli in the

1480
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
about to be famously an Israeli in the
 

1481
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,430
about to be famously an Israeli in the
world you move in going through the

1482
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:51,440
world you move in going through the
 

1483
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,430
world you move in going through the
world has it been different? Has it been

1484
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,440
world has it been different? Has it been
 

1485
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,669
world has it been different? Has it been
harder? Just tell us about it.

1486
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:55,679
harder? Just tell us about it.
 

1487
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,750
harder? Just tell us about it.
Personally

1488
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:57,760
Personally
 

1489
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,149
Personally
um I did not encounter a lot of you know

1490
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:02,159
um I did not encounter a lot of you know
 

1491
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,310
um I did not encounter a lot of you know
anti-semitism. I doing I'm doing events

1492
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
anti-semitism. I doing I'm doing events
 

1493
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,909
anti-semitism. I doing I'm doing events
all over the world. So in a few places

1494
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
all over the world. So in a few places
 

1495
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,430
all over the world. So in a few places
there were demonstrations like we were

1496
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
there were demonstrations like we were
 

1497
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,389
there were demonstrations like we were
in Seo and we had a demonstration of

1498
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399
in Seo and we had a demonstration of
 

1499
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,710
in Seo and we had a demonstration of
people chanting my name somehow linking

1500
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,720
people chanting my name somehow linking
 

1501
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,710
people chanting my name somehow linking
it with genocide.

1502
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:14,720
it with genocide.
 

1503
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,509
it with genocide.
Uh what was it? Harari you can hide you

1504
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
Uh what was it? Harari you can hide you
 

1505
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,990
Uh what was it? Harari you can hide you
you're supporting genocide.

1506
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,000
you're supporting genocide.
 

1507
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,950
you're supporting genocide.
And you know it was eight students.

1508
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:22,960
And you know it was eight students.
 

1509
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,389
And you know it was eight students.
They were not violent and I yeah it's a

1510
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:26,399
They were not violent and I yeah it's a
 

1511
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,149
They were not violent and I yeah it's a
you know it's a free country South Korea

1512
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,159
you know it's a free country South Korea
 

1513
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,149
you know it's a free country South Korea
just had an election. Um and they they

1514
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,159
just had an election. Um and they they
 

1515
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,149
just had an election. Um and they they
are free to demonstrate

1516
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:34,159
are free to demonstrate
 

1517
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,470
are free to demonstrate
and I don't agree with them but I think

1518
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:36,480
and I don't agree with them but I think
 

1519
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,630
and I don't agree with them but I think
they should have the right to say these

1520
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
they should have the right to say these
 

1521
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,110
they should have the right to say these
things. Uh I don't think it's very

1522
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,120
things. Uh I don't think it's very
 

1523
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,909
things. Uh I don't think it's very
constructive but humans often do

1524
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:43,919
constructive but humans often do
 

1525
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,950
constructive but humans often do
unconstructive things.

1526
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
unconstructive things.
 

1527
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,190
unconstructive things.
Um I did I did have a lot of more

1528
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,200
Um I did I did have a lot of more
 

1529
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,190
Um I did I did have a lot of more
constructive conversations all over the

1530
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,200
constructive conversations all over the
 

1531
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,470
constructive conversations all over the
world.

1532
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,480
world.
 

1533
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,470
world.
Uh one of the things that I see for

1534
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
Uh one of the things that I see for
 

1535
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,870
Uh one of the things that I see for
instance in Israel is that people have

1536
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:58,880
instance in Israel is that people have
 

1537
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,830
instance in Israel is that people have
this kind of it's I think part of the

1538
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
this kind of it's I think part of the
 

1539
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,029
this kind of it's I think part of the
government propaganda this extreme idea

1540
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
government propaganda this extreme idea
 

1541
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,549
government propaganda this extreme idea
that

1542
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:06,559
that
 

1543
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,629
that
in the whole world everybody hates us

1544
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
in the whole world everybody hates us
 

1545
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,389
in the whole world everybody hates us
and like I'm talking with people in

1546
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
and like I'm talking with people in
 

1547
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,470
and like I'm talking with people in
Israel and they tell me be be careful in

1548
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:12,480
Israel and they tell me be be careful in
 

1549
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,669
Israel and they tell me be be careful in
London. It's very dangerous there.

1550
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
London. It's very dangerous there.
 

1551
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,430
London. It's very dangerous there.
And again, the the ability of humans to

1552
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,440
And again, the the ability of humans to
 

1553
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,909
And again, the the ability of humans to
invent and and believe in illusions that

1554
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:23,919
invent and and believe in illusions that
 

1555
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:26,629
invent and and believe in illusions that
serve their purposes. Mhm.

1556
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
serve their purposes. Mhm.
 

1557
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,669
serve their purposes. Mhm.
Um I do hope that what you're trying to

1558
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:29,679
Um I do hope that what you're trying to
 

1559
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,829
Um I do hope that what you're trying to
do and have a more constructive and

1560
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:33,839
do and have a more constructive and
 

1561
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,349
do and have a more constructive and
complex conversation, the ability to

1562
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:37,359
complex conversation, the ability to
 

1563
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,030
complex conversation, the ability to
see, you know, the humans have also this

1564
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,040
see, you know, the humans have also this
 

1565
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,829
see, you know, the humans have also this
amazing ability to hold two ideas in

1566
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:45,839
amazing ability to hold two ideas in
 

1567
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,629
amazing ability to hold two ideas in
their mind at the same time.

1568
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
their mind at the same time.
 

1569
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,950
their mind at the same time.
You know, you have these billions, tens

1570
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:50,960
You know, you have these billions, tens
 

1571
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,149
You know, you have these billions, tens
of billions of neurons and trillions of

1572
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,159
of billions of neurons and trillions of
 

1573
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,349
of billions of neurons and trillions of
synapses. They should be able to hold

1574
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
synapses. They should be able to hold
 

1575
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,150
synapses. They should be able to hold
two ideas. I didn't say 10 ideas. Two

1576
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,160
two ideas. I didn't say 10 ideas. Two
 

1577
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,950
two ideas. I didn't say 10 ideas. Two
ideas at the same time.

1578
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:02,960
ideas at the same time.
 

1579
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,870
ideas at the same time.
That Israel has a right to exist and

1580
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:04,880
That Israel has a right to exist and
 

1581
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,790
That Israel has a right to exist and
also Palestine has a right to exist.

1582
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
also Palestine has a right to exist.
 

1583
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,630
also Palestine has a right to exist.
Shouldn't be so difficult.

1584
