1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,310

I'd like to be a little bit more general

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,320
I'd like to be a little bit more general
 

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,070
I'd like to be a little bit more general
than that and to talk about geopolitics

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
than that and to talk about geopolitics
 

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,270
than that and to talk about geopolitics
more generally. Uh geopolitics the

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
more generally. Uh geopolitics the
 

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,070
more generally. Uh geopolitics the
relations among especially the major

8
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
relations among especially the major
 

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,470
relations among especially the major
powers the United States, China, Russia,

10
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
powers the United States, China, Russia,

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,590
powers the United States, China, Russia,
India, uh Europe

12
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
India, uh Europe
 

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,950
India, uh Europe
are at a very difficult and fraught time

14
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
are at a very difficult and fraught time
 

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,070
are at a very difficult and fraught time
and we're in a crisis that is very

16
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
and we're in a crisis that is very
 

17
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,150
and we're in a crisis that is very
serious. It's a crisis because

18
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
serious. It's a crisis because
 

19
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,790
serious. It's a crisis because
we're living in uh the nuclear age.

20
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
we're living in uh the nuclear age.
 

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,510
we're living in uh the nuclear age.
There are nine countries that we know of

22
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
There are nine countries that we know of
 

23
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,750
There are nine countries that we know of
that have nuclear weapons. Maybe some

24
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
that have nuclear weapons. Maybe some
 

25
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,549
that have nuclear weapons. Maybe some
others also do, but nine that we know

26
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
others also do, but nine that we know
 

27
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,990
others also do, but nine that we know
of. Most of those nine are in conflict

28
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
of. Most of those nine are in conflict
 

29
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,869
of. Most of those nine are in conflict
with at least one other country uh that

30
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
with at least one other country uh that
 

31
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,310
with at least one other country uh that
has nuclear weapons in geopolitical or

32
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
has nuclear weapons in geopolitical or
 

33
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,590
has nuclear weapons in geopolitical or
diplomatic terms. and in the case of the

34
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
diplomatic terms. and in the case of the
 

35
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,869
diplomatic terms. and in the case of the
United States and Russia in open

36
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
United States and Russia in open
 

37
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,910
United States and Russia in open
conflict in Ukraine because that's

38
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
conflict in Ukraine because that's
 

39
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,550
conflict in Ukraine because that's
actually a war between the US and Russia

40
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
actually a war between the US and Russia
 

41
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,950
actually a war between the US and Russia
and a very dangerous war. So my view is

42
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
and a very dangerous war. So my view is
 

43
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,070
and a very dangerous war. So my view is
that we need

44
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
that we need
 

45
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,230
that we need
to uh

46
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
to uh
 

47
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,670
to uh
understand the global scene well so that

48
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
understand the global scene well so that
 

49
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,350
understand the global scene well so that
we avoid

50
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
we avoid
 

51
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,190
we avoid
terrible terrible mishaps.

52
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
terrible terrible mishaps.
 

53
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,070
terrible terrible mishaps.
And I often refer to the doomsday clock

54
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,080
And I often refer to the doomsday clock
 

55
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,789
And I often refer to the doomsday clock
of the bulletin of atomic scientists.

56
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
of the bulletin of atomic scientists.
 

57
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,670
of the bulletin of atomic scientists.
This is a US publication that was

58
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
This is a US publication that was
 

59
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,310
This is a US publication that was
started in 1947

60
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
started in 1947
 

61
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,310
started in 1947
after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima

62
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima
 

63
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,109
after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. And it was started by the

64
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
and Nagasaki. And it was started by the
 

65
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,230
and Nagasaki. And it was started by the
atomic scientists who had their journal.

66
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
atomic scientists who had their journal.
 

67
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,710
atomic scientists who had their journal.
And they wanted to tell the world this

68
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
And they wanted to tell the world this
 

69
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,190
And they wanted to tell the world this
is very dangerous indeed. And the risks

70
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
is very dangerous indeed. And the risks
 

71
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,190
is very dangerous indeed. And the risks
of this new age of nuclear weapons is

72
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
of this new age of nuclear weapons is
 

73
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,510
of this new age of nuclear weapons is
unprecedented because the power of

74
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
unprecedented because the power of
 

75
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,270
unprecedented because the power of
destruction is something unlike any time

76
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
destruction is something unlike any time
 

77
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,949
destruction is something unlike any time
before. So they started this clock and

78
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
before. So they started this clock and
 

79
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,830
before. So they started this clock and
the clock puts the hands of the clock

80
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
the clock puts the hands of the clock
 

81
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,030
the clock puts the hands of the clock
closer or farther from midnight.

82
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
closer or farther from midnight.
 

83
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,910
closer or farther from midnight.
And when the clock was started it was 7

84
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
And when the clock was started it was 7
 

85
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,710
And when the clock was started it was 7
minutes from midnight. And the message

86
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
minutes from midnight. And the message
 

87
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,589
minutes from midnight. And the message
to the world was we are close to

88
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
to the world was we are close to
 

89
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,070
to the world was we are close to
destruction because of these new

90
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
destruction because of these new
 

91
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,670
destruction because of these new
weapons. And that was in 1947 when the

92
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
weapons. And that was in 1947 when the
 

93
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,830
weapons. And that was in 1947 when the
US alone had the atomic bomb. But then

94
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
US alone had the atomic bomb. But then
 

95
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,710
US alone had the atomic bomb. But then
of course in 1949

96
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
of course in 1949
 

97
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,390
of course in 1949
that monopoly was broken by the Soviet

98
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
that monopoly was broken by the Soviet
 

99
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,229
that monopoly was broken by the Soviet
Union which developed its atomic bomb

100
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
Union which developed its atomic bomb
 

101
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,830
Union which developed its atomic bomb
and then in the 1950s and 1960s by

102
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
and then in the 1950s and 1960s by
 

103
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,229
and then in the 1950s and 1960s by
Britain, France, China and then we know

104
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
Britain, France, China and then we know
 

105
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,750
Britain, France, China and then we know
Israel sometime in the 1960s

106
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
Israel sometime in the 1960s
 

107
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,910
Israel sometime in the 1960s
uh though never announced exactly uh and

108
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
uh though never announced exactly uh and
 

109
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,790
uh though never announced exactly uh and
then India, Pakistan, North Korea

110
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
then India, Pakistan, North Korea
 

111
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,670
then India, Pakistan, North Korea
and the clock has gone back and forth

112
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
and the clock has gone back and forth
 

113
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,470
and the clock has gone back and forth
depending on geopolitics.

114
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
depending on geopolitics.
 

115
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,070
depending on geopolitics.
It

116
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
It
 

117
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,509
It
went away from midnight at the end of

118
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
went away from midnight at the end of
 

119
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,110
went away from midnight at the end of
the Cold War in 1991.

120
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
the Cold War in 1991.
 

121
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,229
the Cold War in 1991.
The Soviet Union ended. It seemed that

122
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
The Soviet Union ended. It seemed that
 

123
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,670
The Soviet Union ended. It seemed that
there was no more threat, no more cold

124
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
there was no more threat, no more cold
 

125
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,309
there was no more threat, no more cold
war. The US and China were on good

126
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
war. The US and China were on good
 

127
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,110
war. The US and China were on good
relations. the Soviet Union under

128
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
relations. the Soviet Union under
 

129
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,750
relations. the Soviet Union under
Gorbachev and then Russia under

130
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
Gorbachev and then Russia under
 

131
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,670
Gorbachev and then Russia under
President Yelson said, "We just want

132
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
President Yelson said, "We just want
 

133
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,710
President Yelson said, "We just want
good relations. We want to rebuild. We

134
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
good relations. We want to rebuild. We
 

135
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,430
good relations. We want to rebuild. We
want decent relations." So the

136
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
want decent relations." So the
 

137
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,670
want decent relations." So the
scientists put the hand of the doomsday

138
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
scientists put the hand of the doomsday
 

139
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,229
scientists put the hand of the doomsday
clock 17 minutes from midnight.

140
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
clock 17 minutes from midnight.
 

141
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,110
clock 17 minutes from midnight.
Every US presidency since then has

142
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
Every US presidency since then has
 

143
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,830
Every US presidency since then has
experienced the clock coming closer to

144
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
experienced the clock coming closer to
 

145
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,710
experienced the clock coming closer to
midnight. I don't think that's an

146
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
midnight. I don't think that's an
 

147
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,270
midnight. I don't think that's an
accident. I think that is the mistake of

148
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
accident. I think that is the mistake of
 

149
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,429
accident. I think that is the mistake of
American foreign policy which though the

150
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
American foreign policy which though the
 

151
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,670
American foreign policy which though the
United States is the most secure country

152
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
United States is the most secure country
 

153
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,030
United States is the most secure country
in world history in being able to avoid

154
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
in world history in being able to avoid
 

155
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,710
in world history in being able to avoid
an invasion from outside because we're

156
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
an invasion from outside because we're
 

157
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,629
an invasion from outside because we're
not afraid of Canada. We're not afraid

158
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
not afraid of Canada. We're not afraid
 

159
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,870
not afraid of Canada. We're not afraid
of being invaded by Mexico. though there

160
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
of being invaded by Mexico. though there
 

161
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,350
of being invaded by Mexico. though there
once was a war with Mexico in 1846

162
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
once was a war with Mexico in 1846
 

163
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,310
once was a war with Mexico in 1846
but they lost. So this is not a big

164
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
but they lost. So this is not a big
 

165
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,990
but they lost. So this is not a big
threat

166
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
threat
 

167
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,350
threat
and we have two big oceans.

168
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
and we have two big oceans.
 

169
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,350
and we have two big oceans.
So the US should be very calm

170
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
So the US should be very calm
 

171
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,430
So the US should be very calm
and the only threat that the US faces to

172
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
and the only threat that the US faces to
 

173
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,110
and the only threat that the US faces to
its security at all is the possibility

174
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
its security at all is the possibility
 

175
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,310
its security at all is the possibility
of a nuclear war which should not be

176
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
of a nuclear war which should not be
 

177
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,710
of a nuclear war which should not be
hard to avoid. You just have to be

178
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
hard to avoid. You just have to be
 

179
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,990
hard to avoid. You just have to be
cooperative with other nuclear powers.

180
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
cooperative with other nuclear powers.
 

181
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,189
cooperative with other nuclear powers.
But as I said, from 17 minutes to

182
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
But as I said, from 17 minutes to
 

183
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,550
But as I said, from 17 minutes to
midnight, Bill Clinton came, it moved

184
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
midnight, Bill Clinton came, it moved
 

185
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,670
midnight, Bill Clinton came, it moved
closer. George W. Bush Jr. came, it

186
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
closer. George W. Bush Jr. came, it
 

187
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,110
closer. George W. Bush Jr. came, it
moved closer to midnight. Barack Obama

188
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
moved closer to midnight. Barack Obama
 

189
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,350
moved closer to midnight. Barack Obama
moved closer to midnight. Trump won

190
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
moved closer to midnight. Trump won
 

191
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,670
moved closer to midnight. Trump won
moved closer to midnight. Biden closer

192
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
moved closer to midnight. Biden closer
 

193
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,150
moved closer to midnight. Biden closer
to midnight. Now it's 89 seconds to

194
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
to midnight. Now it's 89 seconds to
 

195
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,270
to midnight. Now it's 89 seconds to
midnight. So less than one and a half

196
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
midnight. So less than one and a half
 

197
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,390
midnight. So less than one and a half
minutes to midnight from 17 and a half

198
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
minutes to midnight from 17 and a half
 

199
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,430
minutes to midnight from 17 and a half
minutes. What is going on that every

200
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
minutes. What is going on that every
 

201
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,629
minutes. What is going on that every
administration is moving the hands

202
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
administration is moving the hands
 

203
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,350
administration is moving the hands
closer to midnight? Of course, there are

204
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
closer to midnight? Of course, there are
 

205
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,590
closer to midnight? Of course, there are
many in possible interpretations, but

206
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
many in possible interpretations, but
 

207
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,590
many in possible interpretations, but
mine centers on the United States and

208
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
mine centers on the United States and
 

209
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,390
mine centers on the United States and

210
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
centers on the Western world more
 

211
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,629
centers on the Western world more
generally, by which I mean the US, the

212
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
generally, by which I mean the US, the
 

213
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,390
generally, by which I mean the US, the
European Union, Britain,

214
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
European Union, Britain,
 

215
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,950
European Union, Britain,
Australia, New Zealand, if I could add

216
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
Australia, New Zealand, if I could add
 

217
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,629
Australia, New Zealand, if I could add
those together because those are

218
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
those together because those are
 

219
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,550
those together because those are
offshoots of Britain as well. And in my

220
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
offshoots of Britain as well. And in my
 

221
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,749
offshoots of Britain as well. And in my
view, what is going on is a serious

222
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
view, what is going on is a serious
 

223
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,350
view, what is going on is a serious
misunderstanding

224
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
misunderstanding
 

225
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,350
misunderstanding
of global reality by the leadership of

226
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
of global reality by the leadership of
 

227
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,670
of global reality by the leadership of
my country that has persisted now for

228
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
my country that has persisted now for
 

229
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,029
my country that has persisted now for
more than 30 years. You had a wonderful

230
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
more than 30 years. You had a wonderful
 

231
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,590
more than 30 years. You had a wonderful
debate uh professor Jang with with

232
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
debate uh professor Jang with with
 

233
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,590
debate uh professor Jang with with
Francis Fukuyama

234
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
Francis Fukuyama
 

235
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,390
Francis Fukuyama
uh which I just had the chance to read

236
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
uh which I just had the chance to read
 

237
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,749
uh which I just had the chance to read
from 14 years ago. And as you told me,

238
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
from 14 years ago. And as you told me,
 

239
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,390
from 14 years ago. And as you told me,
you're right. You won the debate. But

240
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
you're right. You won the debate. But
 

241
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,550
you're right. You won the debate. But
the idea of Professor Fukyama

242
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
the idea of Professor Fukyama
 

243
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,469
the idea of Professor Fukyama
already back in uh n the early 1990s was

244
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
already back in uh n the early 1990s was
 

245
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,510
already back in uh n the early 1990s was
that the West had triumphed and it was

246
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
that the West had triumphed and it was
 

247
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,670
that the West had triumphed and it was
the end of history.

248
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
the end of history.
 

249
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,590
the end of history.
And my basic understanding of the

250
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:53,600
And my basic understanding of the
 

251
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,629
And my basic understanding of the
reality is something different.

252
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
reality is something different.
 

253
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,309
reality is something different.
And that is that with the end of the

254
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
And that is that with the end of the
 

255
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,469
And that is that with the end of the
cold war, the world had triumphed in the

256
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
cold war, the world had triumphed in the
 

257
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,270
cold war, the world had triumphed in the
sense that we had the chance to escape

258
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
sense that we had the chance to escape
 

259
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,430
sense that we had the chance to escape
from nuclear war and from confrontation

260
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
from nuclear war and from confrontation
 

261
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,029
from nuclear war and from confrontation
and we had the chance for rapid economic

262
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
and we had the chance for rapid economic
 

263
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,070
and we had the chance for rapid economic
development in all parts of the world

264
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
development in all parts of the world
 

265
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,390
development in all parts of the world
which China led and China exemplified.

266
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
which China led and China exemplified.
 

267
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,430
which China led and China exemplified.
So from the 40 years from 1980 to 2020,

268
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
So from the 40 years from 1980 to 2020,
 

269
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,230
So from the 40 years from 1980 to 2020,
China experienced the fastest economic

270
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
China experienced the fastest economic
 

271
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,990
China experienced the fastest economic
development in world history for a large

272
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
development in world history for a large
 

273
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,950
development in world history for a large
country. And it showed what's possible

274
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
country. And it showed what's possible
 

275
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,710
country. And it showed what's possible
in our world today because of

276
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
in our world today because of
 

277
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,430
in our world today because of
technology, education,

278
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
technology, education,
 

279
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,469
technology, education,
infrastructure, how big an advance can

280
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
infrastructure, how big an advance can
 

281
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,589
infrastructure, how big an advance can
be made. And I watched this, by the way,

282
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
be made. And I watched this, by the way,
 

283
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,469
be made. And I watched this, by the way,
with my own eyes personally because my

284
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
with my own eyes personally because my
 

285
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,909
with my own eyes personally because my
first visit to China was 1981.

286
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
first visit to China was 1981.
 

287
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,550
first visit to China was 1981.
And so China was not a rich country in

288
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
And so China was not a rich country in
 

289
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,950
And so China was not a rich country in
1981. Uh China was very poor in 1981

290
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
1981. Uh China was very poor in 1981
 

291
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,629
1981. Uh China was very poor in 1981
because of the history of the previous

292
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
because of the history of the previous
 

293
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,029
because of the history of the previous
150 years. And over that 40-year period,

294
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
150 years. And over that 40-year period,
 

295
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,950
150 years. And over that 40-year period,
which is the period of my professional

296
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
which is the period of my professional
 

297
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,589
which is the period of my professional
life, China experienced this rapid

298
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
life, China experienced this rapid
 

299
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,070
life, China experienced this rapid
development. And my view is that's

300
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
development. And my view is that's
 

301
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,230
development. And my view is that's
what's possible in all parts of the

302
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
what's possible in all parts of the
 

303
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,150
what's possible in all parts of the
world. So, while I completely hail

304
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
world. So, while I completely hail
 

305
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,869
world. So, while I completely hail
China's accomplishment and know that it

306
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
China's accomplishment and know that it
 

307
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,550
China's accomplishment and know that it
draws on deep roots of China's history

308
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
draws on deep roots of China's history
 

309
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,550
draws on deep roots of China's history
and civilization,

310
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
and civilization,
 

311
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,469
and civilization,
I do believe it's something that all

312
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
I do believe it's something that all
 

313
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,430
I do believe it's something that all
regions of the world can accomplish.

314
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
regions of the world can accomplish.
 

315
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,230
regions of the world can accomplish.
Maybe not at the same speed, maybe not

316
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
Maybe not at the same speed, maybe not
 

317
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,350
Maybe not at the same speed, maybe not
with all the same success as China, but

318
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
with all the same success as China, but
 

319
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,750
with all the same success as China, but
I do not write off any part of the

320
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
I do not write off any part of the
 

321
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,670
I do not write off any part of the
world, Africa or India or South Asia or

322
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
world, Africa or India or South Asia or
 

323
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,750
world, Africa or India or South Asia or
Central Asia or Latin America. This idea

324
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
Central Asia or Latin America. This idea
 

325
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,829
Central Asia or Latin America. This idea
that we could all live in peace, in

326
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
that we could all live in peace, in
 

327
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,150
that we could all live in peace, in
mutual prosperity

328
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
mutual prosperity
 

329
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,949
mutual prosperity
with rapid economic development in poor

330
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
with rapid economic development in poor
 

331
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,350
with rapid economic development in poor
countries, I think is the reality of our

332
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
countries, I think is the reality of our
 

333
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,790
countries, I think is the reality of our
world in its potential, but obviously

334
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
world in its potential, but obviously
 

335
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,190
world in its potential, but obviously
not the reality of our world in its

336
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
not the reality of our world in its
 

337
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,710
not the reality of our world in its
actuality.

338
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
actuality.
 

339
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,269
actuality.
So we need to understand the world as it

340
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
So we need to understand the world as it
 

341
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,030
So we need to understand the world as it
could be and then aim to achieve that

342
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
could be and then aim to achieve that
 

343
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,949
could be and then aim to achieve that
world. Unfortunately this was not the

344
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
world. Unfortunately this was not the
 

345
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,230
world. Unfortunately this was not the
idea of the United States at the end of

346
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
idea of the United States at the end of
 

347
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,990
idea of the United States at the end of
1991

348
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
1991
 

349
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,430
1991
when Mr. Fukuyama, Professor Fukyama

350
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
when Mr. Fukuyama, Professor Fukyama
 

351
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,550
when Mr. Fukuyama, Professor Fukyama
declared the end of history. The idea

352
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
declared the end of history. The idea
 

353
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,949
declared the end of history. The idea
was that the western world would lead

354
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
was that the western world would lead
 

355
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,870
was that the western world would lead
the world from now onward and especially

356
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
the world from now onward and especially
 

357
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,030
the world from now onward and especially
the United States within the western

358
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
the United States within the western
 

359
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,470
the United States within the western
world would lead the world onward.

360
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
world would lead the world onward.
 

361
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,870
world would lead the world onward.
Whether other regions developed or not

362
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
Whether other regions developed or not
 

363
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,949
Whether other regions developed or not
was of modest interest, but if they did

364
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
was of modest interest, but if they did
 

365
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,110
was of modest interest, but if they did
develop, they needed to develop under

366
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
develop, they needed to develop under
 

367
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,590
develop, they needed to develop under
the wing of the United States. In other

368
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
the wing of the United States. In other
 

369
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,070
the wing of the United States. In other
words, what was important at the end of

370
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,080
words, what was important at the end of
 

371
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,910
words, what was important at the end of
the cold war was dominance, not

372
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
the cold war was dominance, not
 

373
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,430
the cold war was dominance, not
cooperation

374
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
cooperation
 

375
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,870
cooperation
or peace. And this is why I think the

376
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
or peace. And this is why I think the
 

377
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,790
or peace. And this is why I think the
world has remained and become more and

378
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
world has remained and become more and
 

379
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,110
world has remained and become more and
more dangerous over the last 35 years.

380
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
more dangerous over the last 35 years.
 

381
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,110
more dangerous over the last 35 years.
So to my

382
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
So to my
 

383
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,350
So to my
understanding, we have a mindset

384
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
understanding, we have a mindset
 

385
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,110
understanding, we have a mindset
problem. And the mindset problem is that

386
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
problem. And the mindset problem is that
 

387
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,030
problem. And the mindset problem is that
the western world dominated the world

388
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
the western world dominated the world
 

389
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,630
the western world dominated the world
economy and world politics and finance

390
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
economy and world politics and finance
 

391
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,069
economy and world politics and finance
for about 250 years. Roughly from 1750

392
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
for about 250 years. Roughly from 1750
 

393
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,150
for about 250 years. Roughly from 1750
to roughly the year 2000.

394
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
to roughly the year 2000.
 

395
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,310
to roughly the year 2000.
And during that period, the ideology in

396
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
And during that period, the ideology in
 

397
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,430
And during that period, the ideology in
the western world explained that

398
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
the western world explained that
 

399
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,430
the western world explained that
dominance as an inherent

400
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
dominance as an inherent
 

401
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,190
dominance as an inherent
rightful feature of the world. And it

402
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
rightful feature of the world. And it
 

403
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,670
rightful feature of the world. And it
explained that dominance in a number of

404
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
explained that dominance in a number of
 

405
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,870
explained that dominance in a number of
different ways. Some very extreme, some

406
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
different ways. Some very extreme, some
 

407
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,509
different ways. Some very extreme, some
a little bit less extreme because there

408
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
a little bit less extreme because there
 

409
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,710
a little bit less extreme because there
were theories of racial superiority.

410
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
were theories of racial superiority.
 

411
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,190
were theories of racial superiority.
There were theories of social

412
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
There were theories of social
 

413
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,710
There were theories of social
superiority.

superiority.
 

415
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,470
superiority.
There were theories of cultural

416
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
There were theories of cultural
 

417
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,190
There were theories of cultural
superiority. There were theories of

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
superiority. There were theories of
 

419
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,750
superiority. There were theories of
religious superiority that this was a

420
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
religious superiority that this was a
 

421
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,790
religious superiority that this was a
Christian world after all. But whichever

422
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
Christian world after all. But whichever
 

423
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,269
Christian world after all. But whichever
theory one subscribed to, there were

theory one subscribed to, there were
 

425
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,670
theory one subscribed to, there were
theories of genetic superiority,

426
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
theories of genetic superiority,
 

427
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,310
theories of genetic superiority,
biological superiority.

biological superiority.
 

429
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,949
biological superiority.
Whichever view one took uh the idea was

430
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
Whichever view one took uh the idea was
 

431
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:47,269
Whichever view one took uh the idea was
deeply embedded in the mores the stories

deeply embedded in the mores the stories

of the world's problems today can be
 

441
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,069
of the world's problems today can be
traced to them actually one was Britain

442
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
traced to them actually one was Britain
 

443
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,550
traced to them actually one was Britain
and China had quite an interesting

444
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
and China had quite an interesting
 

445
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,430
and China had quite an interesting
experience with Britain starting from

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
experience with Britain starting from

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,269
experience with Britain starting from
1793

448
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
1793
 

449
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,710
1793
uh up through uh probably the end of

450
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
uh up through uh probably the end of
 

451
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,350
uh up through uh probably the end of
World War II. And the other has been the

452
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
World War II. And the other has been the
 

453
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,430
World War II. And the other has been the
United States which is a a successor uh

454
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
United States which is a a successor uh
 

455
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,550
United States which is a a successor uh
to Britain in both the Western world and

to Britain in both the Western world and
 

457
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,389
to Britain in both the Western world and
the Anglo-Saxon world. So the British

458
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
the Anglo-Saxon world. So the British
 

459
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,910
the Anglo-Saxon world. So the British
definitely had an arrogance of power. Uh

460
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
definitely had an arrogance of power. Uh
 

461
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,670
definitely had an arrogance of power. Uh
and they used that arrogance of power in

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
and they used that arrogance of power in
 

463
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,590
and they used that arrogance of power in
China, in India, in Russia, in every

China, in India, in Russia, in every

China, in India, in Russia, in every
part of the world because the belief was

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
part of the world because the belief was
 

467
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,110
part of the world because the belief was
that Britain was the empire on which the

that Britain was the empire on which the
 

469
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,389
that Britain was the empire on which the
sun never set. Uh this was the era of

470
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
sun never set. Uh this was the era of
 

471
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,870
sun never set. Uh this was the era of
pox Britannica, although it wasn't so

472
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
pox Britannica, although it wasn't so
 

473
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,230
pox Britannica, although it wasn't so
peaceful, but it was the era of British

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
peaceful, but it was the era of British
 

475
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,030
peaceful, but it was the era of British
dominance. And the 19th century was

476
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
dominance. And the 19th century was
 

477
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,509
dominance. And the 19th century was
really defined by British dominance

478
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
really defined by British dominance
 

479
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,110
really defined by British dominance

481
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,069
internationally.
Europe experienced two

482
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
Europe experienced two
 

483
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,190
Europe experienced two
uh disastrous civil wars in the first

484
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
uh disastrous civil wars in the first
 

485
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,710
uh disastrous civil wars in the first
half of the 20th century which we call

486
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
half of the 20th century which we call
 

487
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,870
half of the 20th century which we call
World War I and World War II. But in

488
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
World War I and World War II. But in
 

489
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,710
World War I and World War II. But in
Europe they were really civil wars

490
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
Europe they were really civil wars
 

491
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,910
Europe they were really civil wars
within European countries. And at the

492
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
within European countries. And at the
 

493
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,990
within European countries. And at the
end Britain was no longer able to

494
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
end Britain was no longer able to
 

495
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,790
end Britain was no longer able to
maintain a global empire. But the United

496
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
maintain a global empire. But the United
 

497
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,750
maintain a global empire. But the United
States took over at that point and the

498
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
States took over at that point and the
 

499
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,790
States took over at that point and the
US inherited the mindset and the

500
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
US inherited the mindset and the
 

501
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,750
US inherited the mindset and the
institutions of British imperial rule.

502
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
institutions of British imperial rule.
 

503
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,629
institutions of British imperial rule.
The main geopolitical

504
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
The main geopolitical
 

505
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,470
The main geopolitical
institution of British imperial rule was

506
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
institution of British imperial rule was
 

507
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,629
institution of British imperial rule was
to control regimes of different parts of

508
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
to control regimes of different parts of
 

509
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,230
to control regimes of different parts of
the world. So Britain mastered what we

510
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
the world. So Britain mastered what we
 

511
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,190
the world. So Britain mastered what we
call regime change operations. If you

512
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:53,200
call regime change operations. If you
 

513
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,069
call regime change operations. If you
don't like a government, replace it.

514
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079
don't like a government, replace it.
 

515
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,150
don't like a government, replace it.
It's a different kind of foreign policy

516
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
It's a different kind of foreign policy
 

517
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,949
It's a different kind of foreign policy
from diplomacy. In diplomacy, if you

518
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
from diplomacy. In diplomacy, if you
 

519
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,629
from diplomacy. In diplomacy, if you
don't like a government, sit down and

520
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
don't like a government, sit down and
 

521
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,230
don't like a government, sit down and
negotiate.

522
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
negotiate.
 

523
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,030
negotiate.
If you're British in the 19th century

524
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
If you're British in the 19th century
 

525
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,030
If you're British in the 19th century
and you don't like a government,

526
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
and you don't like a government,
 

527
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,389
and you don't like a government,
threaten it, kill the person, the ruler,

528
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:12,399
threaten it, kill the person, the ruler,
 

529
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,829
threaten it, kill the person, the ruler,
or overthrow it. uh and this was the

530
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
or overthrow it. uh and this was the
 

531
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,350
or overthrow it. uh and this was the
main mode of British uh action. In the

532
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
main mode of British uh action. In the
 

533
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,310
main mode of British uh action. In the
second half of the 20th century, the

534
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
second half of the 20th century, the
 

535
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,430
second half of the 20th century, the
United States took over that method of

536
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
United States took over that method of
 

537
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,750
United States took over that method of
operation. Indeed, the British taught it

538
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
operation. Indeed, the British taught it
 

539
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,310
operation. Indeed, the British taught it
to the Americans, I would say. And in

540
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
to the Americans, I would say. And in
 

541
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,910
to the Americans, I would say. And in
1953,

542
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
1953,
 

543
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,790
1953,
we did a joint venture together, the

544
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
we did a joint venture together, the
 

545
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,150
we did a joint venture together, the
British and the Americans,

546
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
British and the Americans,
 

547
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,670
British and the Americans,
the British MI6, the spy agency, and the

548
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
the British MI6, the spy agency, and the
 

549
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,829
the British MI6, the spy agency, and the
CIA to overthrow the government of Iran,

550
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
CIA to overthrow the government of Iran,
 

551
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,590
CIA to overthrow the government of Iran,
which brings us to our current

552
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
which brings us to our current
 

553
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,310
which brings us to our current
situation. Iran had a functioning

554
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
situation. Iran had a functioning
 

555
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,310
situation. Iran had a functioning
democratic government in 1953

556
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
democratic government in 1953
 

557
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,189
democratic government in 1953
led by Prime Minister Mosedc.

558
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
led by Prime Minister Mosedc.
 

559
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,150
led by Prime Minister Mosedc.
He had a very radical idea. Mosedc's

560
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
He had a very radical idea. Mosedc's
 

561
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,150
He had a very radical idea. Mosedc's
idea in 1953 was that the oil that was

562
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
idea in 1953 was that the oil that was
 

563
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,870
idea in 1953 was that the oil that was
under the ground actually belonged to

564
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
under the ground actually belonged to
 

565
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,829
under the ground actually belonged to
the Iranians where the British knew that

566
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
the Iranians where the British knew that
 

567
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,230
the Iranians where the British knew that
it belonged to the British.

568
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
it belonged to the British.
 

569
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,870
it belonged to the British.
So when the Iranian prime minister

570
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
So when the Iranian prime minister
 

571
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,350
So when the Iranian prime minister
democratically elected said this is our

572
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
democratically elected said this is our
 

573
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,389
democratically elected said this is our
oil it's under our ground

574
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
oil it's under our ground
 

575
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,550
oil it's under our ground
the uh British government knew that it

576
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
the uh British government knew that it
 

577
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,910
the uh British government knew that it
had to overthrow him and it connected

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
had to overthrow him and it connected
 

579
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,389
had to overthrow him and it connected
with the US government and they made a

580
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
with the US government and they made a
 

581
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,350
with the US government and they made a
secret operation to overthrow Mosedc and

582
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
secret operation to overthrow Mosedc and
 

583
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,829
secret operation to overthrow Mosedc and
to install the sha of Iran a palevi

584
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
to install the sha of Iran a palevi
 

585
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,350
to install the sha of Iran a palevi
dynasty and to make a police state under

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
dynasty and to make a police state under
 

587
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,509
dynasty and to make a police state under
US control.

588
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
US control.
 

589
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,269
US control.
If you add up all such regime change

590
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
If you add up all such regime change
 

591

If you add up all such regime change
operations by the United States between

covert regime change operations by the

covert regime change operations by the
 

607
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,069
covert regime change operations by the
United States, mostly CIAled

and six overt regime change operations,

00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
and six overt regime change operations,
 

611
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,870
and six overt regime change operations,
meaning an open war to topple another

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
meaning an open war to topple another
 

613
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,829
meaning an open war to topple another
government. So 70 regime change

614
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
government. So 70 regime change
 

615
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,189
government. So 70 regime change
operations. This is a very distinct kind

616
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
operations. This is a very distinct kind
 

617
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,189
operations. This is a very distinct kind
of statecraft.

618
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
of statecraft.
 

619
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,230
of statecraft.
It is the opposite of diplomacy.

620
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
It is the opposite of diplomacy.
 

621
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,550
It is the opposite of diplomacy.
You don't have to deal with the other

622
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
You don't have to deal with the other
 

623
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,030
You don't have to deal with the other
side. You have to control it or

624
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
side. You have to control it or
 

625
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,470
side. You have to control it or
overthrow it, kill it, assassinate the

631
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,590
fix an election, buy an election, create
unrest to topple a regime. And this

632
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
unrest to topple a regime. And this
 

633
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,350
unrest to topple a regime. And this
happened 64 times

634
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
happened 64 times
 

635
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,870
happened 64 times
covertly.

636

covertly.
 

637
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,510
covertly.
What does covert mean? Covert means that

What does covert mean? Covert means that
 

639
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,870
What does covert mean? Covert means that
the US denied its role even though it

640
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
the US denied its role even though it
 

641
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,150
the US denied its role even though it
was obvious to the people there. So when

642
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
was obvious to the people there. So when
 

643
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,390
was obvious to the people there. So when
these events occur, they're not really

644
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
these events occur, they're not really
 

645
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,549
these events occur, they're not really
covert in the sense of who did this.

646
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
covert in the sense of who did this.
 

647
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,429
covert in the sense of who did this.
Everyone says the United States did it,

648
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
Everyone says the United States did it,
 

649
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,669
Everyone says the United States did it,
but the United States said we didn't

650
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
but the United States said we didn't
 

651
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,470
but the United States said we didn't
have anything to do with it. That wasn't

652
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
have anything to do with it. That wasn't
 

653
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,630
have anything to do with it. That wasn't
us. That was a local unrest.

654
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
us. That was a local unrest.
 

655
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,750
us. That was a local unrest.
So I mention all of this because that

656
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
So I mention all of this because that
 

657
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,270
So I mention all of this because that
kind of arrogant statecraft

658
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
kind of arrogant statecraft
 

659
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,230
kind of arrogant statecraft
which is imperial mentality

660
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
which is imperial mentality
 

661
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,510
which is imperial mentality
was the US mentality from 1945 to 1991.

662
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
was the US mentality from 1945 to 1991.
 

663
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,150
was the US mentality from 1945 to 1991.
It was justified to the American people

664
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
It was justified to the American people
 

665
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,390
It was justified to the American people
as necessary because of the war against

666
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
as necessary because of the war against
 

667
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,950
as necessary because of the war against
global communism. So that was the

668
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
global communism. So that was the
 

669
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,070
global communism. So that was the
explanation that was given. and

670
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
explanation that was given. and
 

671
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,750
explanation that was given. and
especially against the Soviet Union. And

672
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
especially against the Soviet Union. And
 

673
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,710
especially against the Soviet Union. And
the United States accused the Soviet

674
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
the United States accused the Soviet
 

675
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,430
the United States accused the Soviet
Union of wanting to take over the world.

676
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
Union of wanting to take over the world.
 

677
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,230
Union of wanting to take over the world.
And it used that as an explanation to

678
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
And it used that as an explanation to
 

679
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,549
And it used that as an explanation to
try to take over the world, every other

680
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559
try to take over the world, every other
 

681
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,390
try to take over the world, every other
place. And very importantly and

682
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
place. And very importantly and
 

683
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,630
place. And very importantly and
interestingly, the United States

684
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
interestingly, the United States
 

685
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,270
interestingly, the United States
rejected neutrality

686
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
rejected neutrality
 

687
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,630
rejected neutrality
by any country and used the expression,

688
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
by any country and used the expression,
 

689
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,510
by any country and used the expression,
if you are not with us, you are against

690
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
if you are not with us, you are against
 

691
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,110
if you are not with us, you are against
us. So the US also actively opposed

692
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
us. So the US also actively opposed
 

693
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,029
us. So the US also actively opposed
neutrality.

694
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
neutrality.
 

695
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,270
neutrality.
This is also a very interesting peculiar

696
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
This is also a very interesting peculiar
 

697
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,990
This is also a very interesting peculiar
idea because many countries said we

698
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
idea because many countries said we
 

699
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,390
idea because many countries said we
don't want to choose. We want to trade

700
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
don't want to choose. We want to trade
 

701
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,390
don't want to choose. We want to trade
with the Soviet Union. We want to trade

702
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
with the Soviet Union. We want to trade
 

703
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,710
with the Soviet Union. We want to trade
with the United States. We don't have a

704
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
with the United States. We don't have a
 

705
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,830
with the United States. We don't have a
big army. We don't don't attack us, but

706
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
big army. We don't don't attack us, but
 

707
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,230
big army. We don't don't attack us, but
we don't want bad relations with either

708
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
we don't want bad relations with either
 

709
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,430
we don't want bad relations with either
side. And the US said, "No, that's not

710
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
side. And the US said, "No, that's not
 

711
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,630
side. And the US said, "No, that's not
good enough. You're either with us or

712
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
good enough. You're either with us or
 

713
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,590
good enough. You're either with us or
you're against us." And very

714
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
you're against us." And very
 

715
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,990
you're against us." And very
interestingly for scholars here and this

716
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
interestingly for scholars here and this
 

717
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,070
interestingly for scholars here and this
is a room of scholars if you read the

718
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
is a room of scholars if you read the
 

719
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,669
is a room of scholars if you read the
pelpeneisian war by Thusidities which

The Melians said, "We want to be friends

with Sparta."
 

739
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,510
with Sparta."
And the Athenian says, "No, you can't.

740
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520
And the Athenian says, "No, you can't.

So, you must submit to us, otherwise
 

761
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,150
So, you must submit to us, otherwise
we'll have to kill you." And actually in

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,160
we'll have to kill you." And actually in
 

763
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,909
we'll have to kill you." And actually in
history apparently in 416

764
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
history apparently in 416
 

765
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,270
history apparently in 416
BC the Melos said no we will be neutral

766
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
BC the Melos said no we will be neutral
 

767
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,310
BC the Melos said no we will be neutral
and the Athenians invaded and they

768
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
and the Athenians invaded and they
 

769
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,710
and the Athenians invaded and they
killed all the Melian men. Actually

770
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
killed all the Melian men. Actually
 

771
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,110
killed all the Melian men. Actually
of course what the Pelpeneisian war

772
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
of course what the Pelpeneisian war
 

773
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,750
of course what the Pelpeneisian war
really shows is that just 12 years later

774
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:49,760
really shows is that just 12 years later
 

775
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,950
really shows is that just 12 years later
Athens was defeated. So all that

776
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
Athens was defeated. So all that
 

777
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,430
Athens was defeated. So all that
arrogance led to nothing but defeat.

778
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
arrogance led to nothing but defeat.
 

779
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,950
arrogance led to nothing but defeat.
It even shows something more. Sparta

780
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
It even shows something more. Sparta
 

781
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,430
It even shows something more. Sparta
which won the war disappeared from

782
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
which won the war disappeared from
 

783
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,270
which won the war disappeared from
history also. So neither side won in the

784
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
history also. So neither side won in the
 

785
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,270
history also. So neither side won in the
end. The war exhausted both sides and

786
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
end. The war exhausted both sides and
 

787
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,310
end. The war exhausted both sides and
Greece was invaded by Macedonia in the

788
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
Greece was invaded by Macedonia in the
 

789
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,750
Greece was invaded by Macedonia in the
next century. So both sides lost from

790
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
next century. So both sides lost from
 

791
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,510
next century. So both sides lost from
this ongoing war. But the arrogance of

792
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
this ongoing war. But the arrogance of
 

793
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,549
this ongoing war. But the arrogance of
Athens is the arrogance of the United

794
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
Athens is the arrogance of the United
 

795
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,590
Athens is the arrogance of the United
States. And by the way, Athens was a

796
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
States. And by the way, Athens was a
 

797
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,350
States. And by the way, Athens was a
great democracy

798
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
great democracy
 

799
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,350
great democracy
and it had a great arrogance and it made

800
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
and it had a great arrogance and it made
 

801
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,470
and it had a great arrogance and it made
a great selfd disaster by that

802
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
a great selfd disaster by that
 

803
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,070
a great selfd disaster by that
arrogance.

804
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
arrogance.
 

805
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,549
arrogance.
And by being a democracy, they elected a

806
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
And by being a democracy, they elected a
 

807
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,590
And by being a democracy, they elected a
lot of stupid people that were very

808
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
lot of stupid people that were very
 

809
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,470
lot of stupid people that were very
demagogic and that told them, why don't

810
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
demagogic and that told them, why don't
 

811
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,350
demagogic and that told them, why don't
we invade Syracusea? why don't we

812
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
we invade Syracusea? why don't we
 

813
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,230
we invade Syracusea? why don't we
continue the war and they had no sense

814
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240
continue the war and they had no sense
 

815
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,430
continue the war and they had no sense
and they were defeated in the end. So I

816
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,440
and they were defeated in the end. So I
 

817
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,110
and they were defeated in the end. So I
began uh much of my uh work during this

818
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
began uh much of my uh work during this
 

819
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,190
began uh much of my uh work during this
period from 1989 onward. I was already

820
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
period from 1989 onward. I was already
 

821
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,510
period from 1989 onward. I was already
uh working in Latin America. But then

822
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
uh working in Latin America. But then
 

823
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,789
uh working in Latin America. But then
came the end of the cold war. And just

824
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
came the end of the cold war. And just
 

825
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,909
came the end of the cold war. And just
to say I was an adviser to President

is wonderful. The Cold War is over.
 

843
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,390
is wonderful. The Cold War is over.
We're all now in a market economy

844
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
We're all now in a market economy
 

845
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,350
We're all now in a market economy
worldwide. We can all share in

846
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
worldwide. We can all share in
 

847
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,270
worldwide. We can all share in
prosperity.

848
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
prosperity.
 

849
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,149
prosperity.
The poorer countries can grow faster and

850
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
The poorer countries can grow faster and
 

851
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,549
The poorer countries can grow faster and
close the income gap with the richer

852
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
close the income gap with the richer
 

853
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,029
close the income gap with the richer
countries and the richer countries

854
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
countries and the richer countries
 

855
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,789
countries and the richer countries
should help the poorer countries to

856
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
should help the poorer countries to
 

857
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,430
should help the poorer countries to
catch up and then we'll have a safe,

858
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
catch up and then we'll have a safe,
 

859
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,430
catch up and then we'll have a safe,
prosperous world. And I also believed

860
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
prosperous world. And I also believed
 

861
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,830
prosperous world. And I also believed
and believe today as an economist

862
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
and believe today as an economist
 

863
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,549
and believe today as an economist
there's enough to go around because

864
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
there's enough to go around because
 

865
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,710
there's enough to go around because
another theory of economics the

866
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
another theory of economics the
 

867
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,750
another theory of economics the
Malthusian theory is there's not enough

868
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
Malthusian theory is there's not enough
 

869
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,630
Malthusian theory is there's not enough
for everybody. So the fighting is

870
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
for everybody. So the fighting is
 

871
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,149
for everybody. So the fighting is
inevitable.

872
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
inevitable.
 

873
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,390
inevitable.
There will always be those who lose in

874
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
There will always be those who lose in
 

875
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,470
There will always be those who lose in
the end because there's not enough for

876
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
the end because there's not enough for
 

877
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,430
the end because there's not enough for
everybody in the world. We could discuss

878
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
everybody in the world. We could discuss
 

879
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,350
everybody in the world. We could discuss
that but I reject that on economic

880
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
that but I reject that on economic
 

881
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,549
that but I reject that on economic
grounds. In other words, not out of

882
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
grounds. In other words, not out of
 

883
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,350
grounds. In other words, not out of
moral theory, but out of practical

884
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
moral theory, but out of practical
 

885
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,710
moral theory, but out of practical
theory, we could have everybody living a

886
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:36,720
theory, we could have everybody living a
 

887
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,510
theory, we could have everybody living a
good life as long as they're using solar

888
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
good life as long as they're using solar
 

889
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,870
good life as long as they're using solar
power, not if they're using fossil fuel.

890
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
power, not if they're using fossil fuel.
 

891
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,710
power, not if they're using fossil fuel.
So, as long as we make the right

892
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
So, as long as we make the right
 

893
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,190
So, as long as we make the right
technological choices, then there's

894
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
technological choices, then there's
 

895
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,270
technological choices, then there's
enough to go around in the world for

896
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,280
enough to go around in the world for
 

897
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,070
enough to go around in the world for
everybody in the world.

898
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,080
everybody in the world.
 

899
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,510
everybody in the world.
That's what I argued in the early 1990s.

900
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
That's what I argued in the early 1990s.
 

901
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,669
That's what I argued in the early 1990s.
The United States, however, maintained

902
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
The United States, however, maintained
 

903
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,110
The United States, however, maintained
and even intensified its imperial idea.

904
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
and even intensified its imperial idea.
 

905
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,950
and even intensified its imperial idea.
Instead of viewing the end of the Cold

906
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
Instead of viewing the end of the Cold
 

907
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,310
Instead of viewing the end of the Cold
War as the opportunity for a new world

908
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
War as the opportunity for a new world
 

909
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,789
War as the opportunity for a new world
order that was balanced, fair, peaceful,

910
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
order that was balanced, fair, peaceful,
 

911
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,510
order that was balanced, fair, peaceful,
the United States viewed the end of the

912
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,520
the United States viewed the end of the
 

913
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,070
the United States viewed the end of the
Cold War as the opportunity for

914
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,080
Cold War as the opportunity for
 

915
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,830
Cold War as the opportunity for
hegemony.

916
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840
hegemony.
 

917
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,909
hegemony.
And that's very explicit. This became

918
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:25,919
And that's very explicit. This became
 

919
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,830
And that's very explicit. This became
the ideology

920
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
the ideology
 

921
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,470
the ideology
of the so-called neoconservatives

922
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
of the so-called neoconservatives
 

923
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,750
of the so-called neoconservatives
who dominated American politics from

924
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
who dominated American politics from
 

925
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,269
who dominated American politics from
1991

926
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
1991
 

927
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,070
1991
basically until today. And the

928
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
basically until today. And the
 

929
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,710
basically until today. And the
neoconservative idea is the world can

930
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
neoconservative idea is the world can
 

931
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,710
neoconservative idea is the world can
only be safe if the US leads the world

932
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
only be safe if the US leads the world
 

933
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,830
only be safe if the US leads the world
because the US is a power for good. And

934
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
because the US is a power for good. And
 

935
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,149
because the US is a power for good. And
so the US should set the rules. It

936
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
so the US should set the rules. It
 

937
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,470
so the US should set the rules. It
should be the world policeman. It should

938
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
should be the world policeman. It should
 

939
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,390
should be the world policeman. It should
determine what happens in each part of

940
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:54,400
determine what happens in each part of
 

941
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,789
determine what happens in each part of
the world and then things will be fine.

942
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
the world and then things will be fine.
 

943
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,430
the world and then things will be fine.
This is a very arrogant position. Of

944
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
This is a very arrogant position. Of
 

945
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,510
This is a very arrogant position. Of
course, it's a very delusional idea, but

946
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520
course, it's a very delusional idea, but
 

947
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,870
course, it's a very delusional idea, but
it is really the idea that was espoused

948
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
it is really the idea that was espoused
 

949
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,149
it is really the idea that was espoused
by government after government starting

950
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
by government after government starting
 

951
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,230
by government after government starting
in 1991.

952
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
in 1991.
 

953
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,830
in 1991.
And I witnessed it close up because my

954
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:19,840
And I witnessed it close up because my
 

955
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,230
And I witnessed it close up because my
argument as an economist was that we

956
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
argument as an economist was that we
 

957
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,990
argument as an economist was that we
should help Russia to get back on its

958
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
should help Russia to get back on its
 

959
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,350
should help Russia to get back on its
feet. We should help Africa to achieve

960
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
feet. We should help Africa to achieve
 

961
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,149
feet. We should help Africa to achieve
development. We should make sure that

962
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
development. We should make sure that
 

963
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,990
development. We should make sure that
poverty is overcome everywhere. And none

964
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
poverty is overcome everywhere. And none
 

965
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,230
poverty is overcome everywhere. And none
of those ideas was accepted in the

966
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
of those ideas was accepted in the
 

967
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,510
of those ideas was accepted in the
American political leadership. Even by

968
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,520
American political leadership. Even by
 

969
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,950
American political leadership. Even by
my own colleagues who were in positions

970
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
my own colleagues who were in positions
 

971
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,590
my own colleagues who were in positions
of power temporarily, they viewed

972
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
of power temporarily, they viewed
 

973
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,710
of power temporarily, they viewed
such ideas as naive

974
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
such ideas as naive
 

975
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,350
such ideas as naive
uh and uh as contrary to American

976
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
uh and uh as contrary to American
 

977
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,870
uh and uh as contrary to American
interests. America's interest is to be

978
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
interests. America's interest is to be
 

979
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,510
interests. America's interest is to be
number one, not to be cooperative in an

980
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
number one, not to be cooperative in an
 

981
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,230
number one, not to be cooperative in an
open world in which there is shared

982
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
open world in which there is shared
 

983
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,830
open world in which there is shared
prosperity.

984
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:09,840
prosperity.
 

985
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,909
prosperity.
So the ideology was in my view uh made

986
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
So the ideology was in my view uh made
 

987
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,190
So the ideology was in my view uh made
even worse by the end of the cold war.

988
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
even worse by the end of the cold war.
 

989
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,830
even worse by the end of the cold war.
It turned out, by the way, and it's

990
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
It turned out, by the way, and it's
 

991
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,710
It turned out, by the way, and it's
relevant for China also, during the Cold

992
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
relevant for China also, during the Cold
 

993
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,230
relevant for China also, during the Cold
War, all of the US rhetoric was, "We

994
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240
War, all of the US rhetoric was, "We
 

995
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,950

fight the Soviet Union because of world
communism."

communism."

communism."
That word, as you know, in the American

1000
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
That word, as you know, in the American
 

1001
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,870
That word, as you know, in the American
scene

1002
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
scene
 

1003
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,630
scene
is viewed as something completely uh

1004
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
is viewed as something completely uh
 

1005
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,470
is viewed as something completely uh
shocking.

1006
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
shocking.
 

1007
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,110
shocking.
when Russia became independent and

1008
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,120
when Russia became independent and
 

1009
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,350
when Russia became independent and
declared

1010
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
declared
 

1011
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,029
declared
uh we are in a market economy

1012
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
uh we are in a market economy
 

1013
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,950
uh we are in a market economy
postcommunist this is a another age it

1014
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
postcommunist this is a another age it
 

1015
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,990
postcommunist this is a another age it
made no difference to American politics

1016
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
made no difference to American politics
 

1017
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,430
made no difference to American politics
this is quite interesting in practice

1018
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
this is quite interesting in practice
 

1019
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,070
this is quite interesting in practice
Russia was still an enemy even

1020
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,080
Russia was still an enemy even
 

1021
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,990
Russia was still an enemy even
afterwards because it wasn't really

1022
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
afterwards because it wasn't really
 

1023
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,870
afterwards because it wasn't really
communism or ideology ology. It was

1024
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
communism or ideology ology. It was
 

1025
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,230
communism or ideology ology. It was
simply big powers.

1026
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
simply big powers.
 

1027
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,950
simply big powers.
And in this, John Mirshimer is right

1028
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
And in this, John Mirshimer is right
 

1029
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,669
And in this, John Mirshimer is right
about the American mentality,

1030
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:23,679
about the American mentality,
 

1031
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,070
about the American mentality,
which is that the United States sees

1032
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
which is that the United States sees
 

1033
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,590
which is that the United States sees
Russia as a threat, not because of any

1034
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
Russia as a threat, not because of any
 

1035
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,149
Russia as a threat, not because of any
specific ideology, but because it is

1036
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:32,159
specific ideology, but because it is
 

1037
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,149
specific ideology, but because it is
big. And the United States sees China as

1038
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,159
big. And the United States sees China as
 

1039
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,029
big. And the United States sees China as
a threat. not because of anything that

1040
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,039
a threat. not because of anything that
 

1041
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,830
a threat. not because of anything that
China does or is other than being big

1042
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
China does or is other than being big
 

1043
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,909
China does or is other than being big
and successful.

1044
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919
and successful.
 

1045
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,310
and successful.
And therefore, China's only offense is

1046
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
And therefore, China's only offense is
 

1047
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,230
And therefore, China's only offense is
that it threatens American dominance.

1048
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
that it threatens American dominance.
 

1049
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,149
that it threatens American dominance.
And that I think is a succinct

1050
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
And that I think is a succinct
 

1051
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,870
And that I think is a succinct
description of the viewpoint of the

1052
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
description of the viewpoint of the
 

1053
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,430
description of the viewpoint of the
American leadership. Now to come back to

1054
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:03,440
American leadership. Now to come back to
 

1055
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,950
American leadership. Now to come back to
my view of economics, this is a terrible

1056
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
my view of economics, this is a terrible
 

1057
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,070
my view of economics, this is a terrible
mistake. Not only on a moral level, but

1058
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
mistake. Not only on a moral level, but
 

1059
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,269
mistake. Not only on a moral level, but
on a practical level. The United States

1060
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
on a practical level. The United States
 

1061
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,789
on a practical level. The United States
has 4% of the world population,

1062
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
has 4% of the world population,
 

1063
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,350
has 4% of the world population,
335 million people. How could 4% of the

1064
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
335 million people. How could 4% of the
 

1065
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,950
335 million people. How could 4% of the
world dominate the world? It's not

1066
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
world dominate the world? It's not
 

1067
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,070
world dominate the world? It's not
possible. except if all the rest of the

1068
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
possible. except if all the rest of the
 

1069
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,990
possible. except if all the rest of the
world were to remain poor, unsuccessful,

1070
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,000
world were to remain poor, unsuccessful,
 

1071
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,149
world were to remain poor, unsuccessful,
backward, and so forth. But there's no

1072
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:36,159
backward, and so forth. But there's no
 

1073
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,310
backward, and so forth. But there's no
not only no moral reason for that,

1074
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
not only no moral reason for that,
 

1075
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,710
not only no moral reason for that,
there's no practical reason why that

1076
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
there's no practical reason why that
 

1077
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,590
there's no practical reason why that
should be the case. So I long believed

1078
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
should be the case. So I long believed
 

1079
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,149
should be the case. So I long believed
that poor countries can grow faster and

1080
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159
that poor countries can grow faster and
 

1081
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,950
that poor countries can grow faster and
catch up. And China, of course, is the

1082
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
catch up. And China, of course, is the
 

1083
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,909
catch up. And China, of course, is the
greatest success story in history of

1084
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
greatest success story in history of
 

1085
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,909
greatest success story in history of
that. But China follows a basic pattern

1086
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
that. But China follows a basic pattern
 

1087
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,510
that. But China follows a basic pattern
that Japan followed previously, that uh

1088
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
that Japan followed previously, that uh
 

1089
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,669
that Japan followed previously, that uh
Hong Kong, Singapore followed previously

1090
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
Hong Kong, Singapore followed previously
 

1091
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,909
Hong Kong, Singapore followed previously
because catching up is possible if the

1092
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:05,919
because catching up is possible if the
 

1093
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,549
because catching up is possible if the
leadership is good, if the planning is

1094
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
leadership is good, if the planning is
 

1095
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,430
leadership is good, if the planning is
good, if the strategy is good, there's

1096
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
good, if the strategy is good, there's
 

1097
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,149
good, if the strategy is good, there's
all this headroom for rapid economic

1098
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,159
all this headroom for rapid economic
 

1099
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,350
all this headroom for rapid economic
growth possible. And China proved the

1100
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,360
growth possible. And China proved the
 

1101
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,789
growth possible. And China proved the
case once again at a scale unprecedented

1102
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:20,799
case once again at a scale unprecedented
 

1103
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,389
case once again at a scale unprecedented
in history.

1104
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
in history.
 

1105
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,909
in history.
So the US viewpoint about dominance

1106
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
So the US viewpoint about dominance
 

1107
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,470
So the US viewpoint about dominance
makes no sense, not only not morally and

1108
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
makes no sense, not only not morally and
 

1109
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,710
makes no sense, not only not morally and
not practically in terms of security,

1110
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720
not practically in terms of security,
 

1111
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,789
not practically in terms of security,
because the world's not safe if the US

1112
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
because the world's not safe if the US
 

1113
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,389
because the world's not safe if the US
is rich and Russia is unstable with

1114
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:38,399
is rich and Russia is unstable with
 

1115
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,310
is rich and Russia is unstable with
nuclear weapons. Why does that make the

1116
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
nuclear weapons. Why does that make the
 

1117
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,230
nuclear weapons. Why does that make the
US secure? That makes the US more

1118
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
US secure? That makes the US more
 

1119
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,710
US secure? That makes the US more
dangerous. But it's also wrong

1120
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
dangerous. But it's also wrong
 

1121
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,230
dangerous. But it's also wrong
economically

1122
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
economically
 

1123
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,269
economically
because Russia will catch up. China will

1124
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:49,279
because Russia will catch up. China will
 

1125
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,029
because Russia will catch up. China will
catch up. Africa will catch up and the

1126
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:53,039
catch up. Africa will catch up and the
 

1127
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,950
catch up. Africa will catch up and the
United States will find out that being

1128
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
United States will find out that being
 

1129
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,510
United States will find out that being
4% of the world population is just 4%.

1130
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
4% of the world population is just 4%.
 

1131
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,470
4% of the world population is just 4%.
It's not enough to rule the world. It

1132
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
It's not enough to rule the world. It
 

1133
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,389
It's not enough to rule the world. It
the US will have to learn to be

1134
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
the US will have to learn to be
 

1135
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,190
the US will have to learn to be
cooperative and will have to learn that

1136
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,200
cooperative and will have to learn that
 

1137
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,830
cooperative and will have to learn that
state craft is more than overthrowing

1138
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
state craft is more than overthrowing
 

1139
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,350
state craft is more than overthrowing
governments.

1140
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
governments.
 

1141
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,830
governments.
But and here I will come to the point

1142
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:13,840
But and here I will come to the point
 

1143
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,510
But and here I will come to the point
about current politics. The US still

1144
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,520
about current politics. The US still
 

1145
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,510
about current politics. The US still
does not understand this till today. And

1146
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
does not understand this till today. And
 

1147
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,470
does not understand this till today. And
the wars that we see and the crisis that

1148
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,480
the wars that we see and the crisis that
 

1149
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,990
the wars that we see and the crisis that
we see are still crises of the old

1150
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,000
we see are still crises of the old
 

1151
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,789
we see are still crises of the old
imperial mentality.

1152
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
imperial mentality.
 

1153
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,669
imperial mentality.
So the war in Ukraine

1154
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:35,679
So the war in Ukraine
 

1155
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,350
So the war in Ukraine
is a war that the US caused,

1156
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
is a war that the US caused,
 

1157
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,590
is a war that the US caused,
not a war that Putin caused, but a war

1158
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
not a war that Putin caused, but a war
 

1159
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,389
not a war that Putin caused, but a war
that the US caused by expanding

1160
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
that the US caused by expanding
 

1161
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,950
that the US caused by expanding
the military alliance NATO eastward and

1162
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
the military alliance NATO eastward and
 

1163
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,110
the military alliance NATO eastward and
trying to set up a military base or

1164
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,120
trying to set up a military base or
 

1165
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,470
trying to set up a military base or
bases in Ukraine and in the South

1166
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480
bases in Ukraine and in the South
 

1167
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,990
bases in Ukraine and in the South
Caucuses,

1168
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,000
Caucuses,
 

1169
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,310
Caucuses,
especially the country Georgia and the

1170
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:04,320
especially the country Georgia and the
 

1171
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,149
especially the country Georgia and the
Russian government said, "No, you can't

1172
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159
Russian government said, "No, you can't
 

1173
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,389
Russian government said, "No, you can't
have military bases on our border. We

1174
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
have military bases on our border. We
 

1175
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,710
have military bases on our border. We
don't accept that. That's that's a real

1176
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
don't accept that. That's that's a real
 

1177
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,190
don't accept that. That's that's a real
security threat for us." And the

1178
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
security threat for us." And the
 

1179
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,190
security threat for us." And the
American position was, "It's none of

1180
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
American position was, "It's none of
 

1181
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,389
American position was, "It's none of
your business, Russia, what we do. If

1182
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:18,399
your business, Russia, what we do. If
 

1183
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,870
your business, Russia, what we do. If
Ukraine says yes, we're going to put our

1184
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:20,880
Ukraine says yes, we're going to put our
 

1185
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,909
Ukraine says yes, we're going to put our
missiles next to you." And President

1186
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:23,919
missiles next to you." And President
 

1187
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,070
missiles next to you." And President
Putin said, "No, you're not. That's

1188
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,080
Putin said, "No, you're not. That's
 

1189
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,269
Putin said, "No, you're not. That's
dangerous for us." And the United States

1190
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
dangerous for us." And the United States
 

1191
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,750
dangerous for us." And the United States
said it's none of your business. And so

1192
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
said it's none of your business. And so
 

1193
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,549
said it's none of your business. And so
this is the essence of the Ukraine

1194
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
this is the essence of the Ukraine
 

1195
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,909
this is the essence of the Ukraine
conflict, which is that the US said we

1196
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
conflict, which is that the US said we
 

1197
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,990
conflict, which is that the US said we
can expand our military reach anywhere.

1198
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000
can expand our military reach anywhere.
 

1199
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,190
can expand our military reach anywhere.
The Russians said not on our border and

1200
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,200
The Russians said not on our border and
 

1201
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,310
The Russians said not on our border and
it finally came to war. Before it came

1202
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
it finally came to war. Before it came
 

1203
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,990
it finally came to war. Before it came
to war, the government in Ukraine in n

1204
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
to war, the government in Ukraine in n
 

1205
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,029
to war, the government in Ukraine in n
in 2010 was very clever. It said, "We

1206
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,039
in 2010 was very clever. It said, "We
 

1207
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,230
in 2010 was very clever. It said, "We
want neutrality." Huh? Well, read

1208
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,240
want neutrality." Huh? Well, read
 

1209
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,430
want neutrality." Huh? Well, read
Thusidities. Uh, the Americans did not

1210
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:03,440
Thusidities. Uh, the Americans did not
 

1211
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,870
Thusidities. Uh, the Americans did not
accept Ukraine's call for neutrality.

1212
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
accept Ukraine's call for neutrality.
 

1213
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,950
accept Ukraine's call for neutrality.
What did the United States do to the

1214
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
What did the United States do to the
 

1215
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,350
What did the United States do to the
president who wanted neutrality? It

1216
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,360
president who wanted neutrality? It
 

1217
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,630
president who wanted neutrality? It
overthrew that president in February

1218
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:14,640
overthrew that president in February
 

1219
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,310
overthrew that president in February
2014.

1220
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,320
2014.
 

1221
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,430
2014.
So, the US made a coup together with

1222
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:19,440
So, the US made a coup together with
 

1223
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,590
So, the US made a coup together with
Ukrainian forces. The US role was quite

1224
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
Ukrainian forces. The US role was quite
 

1225
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,190
Ukrainian forces. The US role was quite
obvious though it was denied. So we can

1226
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
obvious though it was denied. So we can
 

1227
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,430
obvious though it was denied. So we can
call it a covert regime change

1228
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,440
call it a covert regime change
 

1229
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,950
call it a covert regime change
operation.

1230
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
operation.
 

1231
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,669
operation.
I happen to have been told by some of

1232
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:33,679
I happen to have been told by some of
 

1233
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,630
I happen to have been told by some of
the participants just how much the US

1234
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
the participants just how much the US
 

1235
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,950
the participants just how much the US
played a role. And at a crucial moment,

1236
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:40,960
played a role. And at a crucial moment,
 

1237
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,269
played a role. And at a crucial moment,
a phone call by the US diplomat Victoria

1238
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
a phone call by the US diplomat Victoria
 

1239
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,310
a phone call by the US diplomat Victoria
Nuland was intercepted by the Russians

1240
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,320
Nuland was intercepted by the Russians
 

1241
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,710
Nuland was intercepted by the Russians
and posted online and that call said the

1242
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
and posted online and that call said the
 

1243
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,029
and posted online and that call said the
next government should be so and so

1244
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:55,039
next government should be so and so
 

1245
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,870
next government should be so and so
which was the next government actually.

1246
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,880
which was the next government actually.
 

1247
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,630
which was the next government actually.
So the US chose the next government and

1248
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:00,640
So the US chose the next government and
 

1249
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,750
So the US chose the next government and
where is Victoria Nuland today? She is

1250
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:03,760
where is Victoria Nuland today? She is
 

1251
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,870
where is Victoria Nuland today? She is
my colleague at Columbia University. So

1252
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:06,880
my colleague at Columbia University. So
 

1253
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,110
my colleague at Columbia University. So
this is the route to success. Make a

1254
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
this is the route to success. Make a
 

1255
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,269
this is the route to success. Make a
coup and then you get to be a Colombia

1256
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:11,279
coup and then you get to be a Colombia
 

1257
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,669
coup and then you get to be a Colombia
professor. Uh so this is uh the Ukraine

1258
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
professor. Uh so this is uh the Ukraine
 

1259
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,029
professor. Uh so this is uh the Ukraine
conflict. President Trump came into

1260
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:19,039
conflict. President Trump came into
 

1261
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,470
conflict. President Trump came into
office saying I want to stop this war

1262
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
office saying I want to stop this war
 

1263
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,710
office saying I want to stop this war
because it's useless and the Russians

1264
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,720
because it's useless and the Russians
 

1265
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,430
because it's useless and the Russians
are winning on the battlefield.

1266
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,440
are winning on the battlefield.
 

1267
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,389
are winning on the battlefield.
But interestingly, President Trump does

1268
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:30,399
But interestingly, President Trump does
 

1269
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,310
But interestingly, President Trump does
not have the power or the logic to stop

1270
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
not have the power or the logic to stop
 

1271
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,029
not have the power or the logic to stop
the war because he can't say publicly

1272
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
the war because he can't say publicly
 

1273
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,990
the war because he can't say publicly
the obvious. He can't say to the

1274
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
the obvious. He can't say to the
 

1275
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,990
the obvious. He can't say to the
American people, NATO will not expand.

1276
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,000
American people, NATO will not expand.
 

1277
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,630
American people, NATO will not expand.
If he says that, he's declared, "You're

1278
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,640
If he says that, he's declared, "You're
 

1279
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,950
If he says that, he's declared, "You're
a weakling. You're a traitor. You're

1280
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:52,960
a weakling. You're a traitor. You're
 

1281
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,509
a weakling. You're a traitor. You're
making a concession to President Putin.

1282
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:55,519
making a concession to President Putin.
 

1283
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,990
making a concession to President Putin.
You're giving up. you're uh on the

1284
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,000
You're giving up. you're uh on the
 

1285
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,269
You're giving up. you're uh on the
payroll of the Russians. And so the

1286
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
payroll of the Russians. And so the
 

1287
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,110
payroll of the Russians. And so the
imperial logic still prevails even if

1288
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
imperial logic still prevails even if
 

1289
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,270
imperial logic still prevails even if
the individual as president might want

1290
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,280
the individual as president might want
 

1291
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,669
the individual as president might want
to do something different. Of course,

1292
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:11,679
to do something different. Of course,
 

1293
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,829
to do something different. Of course,
none of us can figure out Donald Trump's

1294
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
none of us can figure out Donald Trump's
 

1295
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,750
none of us can figure out Donald Trump's
mentality,

1296
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
mentality,
 

1297
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,869
mentality,
not even Donald Trump. So, we don't know

1298
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
not even Donald Trump. So, we don't know
 

1299
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,589
not even Donald Trump. So, we don't know
what he really truly thinks, but what I

1300
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
what he really truly thinks, but what I
 

1301
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,190
what he really truly thinks, but what I
know is that he seems to want to end the

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,430
know is that he seems to want to end the
Ukraine war, but does not have the

1304
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
Ukraine war, but does not have the
 

1305
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,550
Ukraine war, but does not have the

00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:36,960
him is the militaryindustrial complex
 

1311
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,990
him is the militaryindustrial complex
that says the US can go where it wants.

1312
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,000
that says the US can go where it wants.
 

1313
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,349
that says the US can go where it wants.
Then comes the Middle East conflict.

1314
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:45,359
Then comes the Middle East conflict.
 

1315
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,710
Then comes the Middle East conflict.
second conflict. This is also an

1316
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,720
second conflict. This is also an
 

1317
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,149
second conflict. This is also an
imperial conflict. It started, of

1318
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:52,159
imperial conflict. It started, of
 

1319
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,470
imperial conflict. It started, of
course, as so many conflicts do, with

1320
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
course, as so many conflicts do, with
 

1321
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,550
course, as so many conflicts do, with
the British. And the conflict with

1322
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,560
the British. And the conflict with
 

1323
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,390
the British. And the conflict with
Ukraine, by the way, started with the

1324
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400
Ukraine, by the way, started with the
 

1325
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,349
Ukraine, by the way, started with the
British because in 1853,

1326
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
British because in 1853,
 

1327
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,670
British because in 1853,
Britain went to war against Russia for

1328
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:03,680
Britain went to war against Russia for
 

1329
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,829
Britain went to war against Russia for
exactly the same reason that the United

1330
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:05,839
exactly the same reason that the United
 

1331
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,870
exactly the same reason that the United
States went to war against Russia in

1332
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
States went to war against Russia in
 

1333
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,630
States went to war against Russia in
2014. Britain said, "We need to weaken

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:12,640
2014. Britain said, "We need to weaken
 

1335
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,109
2014. Britain said, "We need to weaken
Russia in 1853." So the war in Ukraine

1336
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
Russia in 1853." So the war in Ukraine
 

1337
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,030
Russia in 1853." So the war in Ukraine
is like the 19th century Crimean War.

1338
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,040
is like the 19th century Crimean War.
 

1339
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,150
is like the 19th century Crimean War.
Almost the same actors, but the United

1340
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,160
Almost the same actors, but the United
 

1341
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,310
Almost the same actors, but the United
States wasn't involved in the first one,

1342
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
States wasn't involved in the first one,
 

1343
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,230
States wasn't involved in the first one,
but Britain was involved in both of

1344
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
but Britain was involved in both of
 

1345
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,550
but Britain was involved in both of
them. When it comes to the Middle East,

1346
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:30,560
them. When it comes to the Middle East,
 

1347
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,470
them. When it comes to the Middle East,
this is also a crisis made by Britain.

1348
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
this is also a crisis made by Britain.
 

1349
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,550
this is also a crisis made by Britain.
uh and it comes from World War I as you

the Middle East was defeated by the
Allied powers the US, France and Britain

Allied powers the US, France and Britain
 

1357
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,790
Allied powers the US, France and Britain
and Britain was the dominant imperial

1358
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:54,800
and Britain was the dominant imperial
 

1359
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,430
and Britain was the dominant imperial
power of the age especially in the

power of the age especially in the
 

1361
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,230
power of the age especially in the
Middle East. It ruled over Egypt. It

Middle East. It ruled over Egypt. It
 

1363
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,349
Middle East. It ruled over Egypt. It
ruled over Aiden which is Yemen today

1364
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
ruled over Aiden which is Yemen today
 

1365
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,990
ruled over Aiden which is Yemen today
because this was the route to Britain's

1366
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,000
because this was the route to Britain's
 

1367
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,710
because this was the route to Britain's
empire in India the seaw route and so

1368
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:10,720
empire in India the seaw route and so
 

1369
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,950
empire in India the seaw route and so
Britain was very careful to control the

1370
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:12,960
Britain was very careful to control the
 

1371
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,349
Britain was very careful to control the
whole sea lane from the Mediterranean to

1372
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:17,359
whole sea lane from the Mediterranean to
 

1373
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,230
whole sea lane from the Mediterranean to
India and India was the crown jewel of

1374
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,240
India and India was the crown jewel of
 

1375
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,710
India and India was the crown jewel of
the British Empire. So at the end of

1376
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:22,720
the British Empire. So at the end of
 

1377
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,670
the British Empire. So at the end of
World War I when the Turkish Empire was

1378
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:25,680
World War I when the Turkish Empire was
 

1379
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,190
World War I when the Turkish Empire was
defeated, Britain aimed to control all

1380
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,200
defeated, Britain aimed to control all
 

1381
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,349
defeated, Britain aimed to control all
of this territory.

1382
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:31,359
of this territory.
 

1383
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,030
of this territory.
And it made many promises and many

1384
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,040
And it made many promises and many
 

1385
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,069
And it made many promises and many
contradictory promises to other powers.

1386
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:38,079
contradictory promises to other powers.
 

1387
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,630
contradictory promises to other powers.
Britain told the Arabs, "You will

1388
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:40,640
Britain told the Arabs, "You will

Britain told the Arabs, "You will
control this region." Britain told the

1391
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,670
control this region." Britain told the
French, "You will control this region."

1392
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,680
French, "You will control this region."
 

1393
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,630
French, "You will control this region."
Britain uh told the Jews, "You will

1394
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
Britain uh told the Jews, "You will
 

1395
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,190
Britain uh told the Jews, "You will
control this region." uh and of course

1396
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200
control this region." uh and of course
 

1397
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,510
control this region." uh and of course
Britain ultimately wanted to control the

1398
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
Britain ultimately wanted to control the
 

1399
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,470
Britain ultimately wanted to control the
region. So this was typical British

1400
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:56,480
region. So this was typical British
 

1401
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,069
region. So this was typical British
imperial

1402
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
imperial
 

1403
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,190
imperial
deceit or duplicity.

1404
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,200
deceit or duplicity.
 

1405
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,109
deceit or duplicity.
But one of the outcomes was the Balffor

1406
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
But one of the outcomes was the Balffor
 

1407
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,710
But one of the outcomes was the Balffor
declaration

1408
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
declaration
 

1409
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,270
declaration
which in which Britain

1410
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
which in which Britain
 

1411
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,150
which in which Britain
called for the establishment of a Jewish

1412
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,160
called for the establishment of a Jewish
 

1413
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,109
called for the establishment of a Jewish
homeland in what was a province of the

1414
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,119
homeland in what was a province of the
 

1415
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,630
homeland in what was a province of the
Ottoman Empire and which was became

1416
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
Ottoman Empire and which was became
 

1417
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,910
Ottoman Empire and which was became
known as Palestine after World War I

1418
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,920
known as Palestine after World War I
 

1419
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,710
known as Palestine after World War I
which was the ancient Roman name uh that

1420
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:26,720
which was the ancient Roman name uh that
 

1421
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,670
which was the ancient Roman name uh that
was used for this territory also. So

1422
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:29,680
was used for this territory also. So
 

1423
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,349
was used for this territory also. So
Britain took over Palestine under the

1424
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:33,359
Britain took over Palestine under the
 

1425
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,390
Britain took over Palestine under the
League of Nations and it said that this

1426
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
League of Nations and it said that this
 

1427
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,109
League of Nations and it said that this
would be a Jewish homeland. This is a

1428
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
would be a Jewish homeland. This is a
 

1429
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,109
would be a Jewish homeland. This is a
very complicated weird story because the

1430
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
very complicated weird story because the
 

1431
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,630
very complicated weird story because the
Jewish

1432
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
Jewish
 

1433
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:51,910
Jewish
faith had his had its uh main temple in

1434
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:51,920
faith had his had its uh main temple in
 

1435
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,990
faith had his had its uh main temple in
this place 2,000 years earlier, but it

1436
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
this place 2,000 years earlier, but it
 

1437
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,349
this place 2,000 years earlier, but it
had been banished from this place by the

1438
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359
had been banished from this place by the
 

1439
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,630
had been banished from this place by the
Roman Empire in the year 135 AD. And now

1440
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:04,640
Roman Empire in the year 135 AD. And now
 

1441
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,550
Roman Empire in the year 135 AD. And now
it was recreating this ancient state.

1442
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:08,560
it was recreating this ancient state.
 

1443
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,270
it was recreating this ancient state.
The only problem was that 95% of the

1444
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:11,280
The only problem was that 95% of the
 

1445
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,790
The only problem was that 95% of the
population was Arabs who did not want a

1446
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:14,800
population was Arabs who did not want a
 

1447
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,550
population was Arabs who did not want a
Jewish homeland in this territory. But

1448
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:18,560
Jewish homeland in this territory. But
 

1449
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,550
Jewish homeland in this territory. But
Britain used its imperial power to force

1450
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560
Britain used its imperial power to force
 

1451
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,790
Britain used its imperial power to force
the inmigration

1452
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
the inmigration
 

1453
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,069
the inmigration
of people of Jewish religion, especially

1454
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
of people of Jewish religion, especially
 

1455
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,430
of people of Jewish religion, especially
from Eastern Europe, to claim a part of

1456
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:33,440
from Eastern Europe, to claim a part of
 

1457
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,349
from Eastern Europe, to claim a part of
uh British controlled Palestine.

1458
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:37,359
uh British controlled Palestine.
 

1459
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,950
uh British controlled Palestine.
And

1460
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:38,960
And
 

1461
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,829
And
a very long story that has led to a

1462
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:41,839
a very long story that has led to a
 

1463
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,950
a very long story that has led to a
100red years of crisis because there was

1464
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:44,960
100red years of crisis because there was
 

1465
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,150
100red years of crisis because there was
a local population. the local population

1466
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,160
a local population. the local population
 

1467
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,390
a local population. the local population
resisted the incoming uh of uh migrants

1468
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,400
resisted the incoming uh of uh migrants
 

1469
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,190
resisted the incoming uh of uh migrants
from Europe especially and then after

1470
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,200
from Europe especially and then after
 

1471
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,349
from Europe especially and then after
uh the state of Israel was established

1472
00:38:59,349 --> 00:38:59,359
uh the state of Israel was established
 

1473
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,109
uh the state of Israel was established
from other regions of the world

1474
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:01,119
from other regions of the world
 

1475
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,990
from other regions of the world
including the Middle East and South Asia

1476
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,000
including the Middle East and South Asia
 

1477
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,190
including the Middle East and South Asia
and the mentality of the British of of

1478
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,200
and the mentality of the British of of
 

1479
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,349
and the mentality of the British of of
the uh Jewish state which was

1480
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:11,359
the uh Jewish state which was
 

1481
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,910
the uh Jewish state which was
established in 1948 by the United

1482
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:13,920
established in 1948 by the United
 

1483
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,470
established in 1948 by the United
Nations was our security depends on

1484
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480
Nations was our security depends on
 

1485
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,550
Nations was our security depends on
having no

1486
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
having no
 

1487
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,190
having no
Arab state next to us that opposes us.

1488
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,200
Arab state next to us that opposes us.
 

1489
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,710
Arab state next to us that opposes us.
And so the idea of sharing

1490
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:28,720
And so the idea of sharing
 

1491
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,470
And so the idea of sharing
the land, which was a UN idea, was

1492
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,480
the land, which was a UN idea, was
 

1493
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,430
the land, which was a UN idea, was
actually rejected by both sides in a

1494
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:35,440
actually rejected by both sides in a
 

1495
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,870
actually rejected by both sides in a
way. The Arabs said, "We're the

1496
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:36,880
way. The Arabs said, "We're the
 

1497
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,589
way. The Arabs said, "We're the
majority. We should rule." And the Jews

1498
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599
majority. We should rule." And the Jews
 

1499
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,829
majority. We should rule." And the Jews
said, "We're the minority. We need to

1500
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:41,839
said, "We're the minority. We need to
 

1501
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,990
said, "We're the minority. We need to
dominate because otherwise we won't be

1502
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
dominate because otherwise we won't be
 

1503
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,270
dominate because otherwise we won't be
safe."

1504
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,280
safe."
 

1505
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,790
safe."
And so this has led from 1948 until

1506
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,800
And so this has led from 1948 until
 

1507
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,270
And so this has led from 1948 until
today to an unresolved

1508
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,280
today to an unresolved
 

1509
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,270
today to an unresolved
war. But remember it this was a state

1510
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280
war. But remember it this was a state
 

1511
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,750
war. But remember it this was a state
created by the British Empire and now

1512
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
created by the British Empire and now
 

1513
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,990
created by the British Empire and now
backed by the US Empire. So, Israel

1514
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
backed by the US Empire. So, Israel
 

1515
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,150
backed by the US Empire. So, Israel
could not survive

1516
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,160
could not survive
 

1517
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,589
could not survive
without the US being the imperial power

1518
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:09,599
without the US being the imperial power
 

1519
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,470
without the US being the imperial power
that enforces Israel's

1520
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
that enforces Israel's
 

1521
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,510
that enforces Israel's
uh power in the region because Israel is

1522
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,520
uh power in the region because Israel is
 

1523
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,550
uh power in the region because Israel is
just 8 million people. The Arab world is

1524
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
just 8 million people. The Arab world is
 

1525
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,390
just 8 million people. The Arab world is
about 400 million people and Israel

1526
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,400
about 400 million people and Israel
 

1527
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,710
about 400 million people and Israel
therefore depends on its security

1528
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:24,720
therefore depends on its security
 

1529
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,750
therefore depends on its security
entirely on the United States.

1530
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
entirely on the United States.
 

1531
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,150
entirely on the United States.
The United States has seen this as an

1532
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,160
The United States has seen this as an
 

1533
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,230
The United States has seen this as an
imperial project that's good for the

1534
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,240
imperial project that's good for the
 

1535
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,870
imperial project that's good for the
United States because if the US

1536
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:36,880
United States because if the US
 

1537
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,670
United States because if the US
has control over the Middle East through

1538
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:39,680
has control over the Middle East through
 

1539
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,790
has control over the Middle East through
Israel, well, that gives the US control

1540
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:42,800
Israel, well, that gives the US control
 

1541
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,829
Israel, well, that gives the US control
effectively militarily in the region.

1542
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
effectively militarily in the region.
 

1543
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,270
effectively militarily in the region.
So, the US has backed Israel for many

1544
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,280
So, the US has backed Israel for many
 

1545
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,589
So, the US has backed Israel for many
decades during this period. It's a very

1546
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:53,599
decades during this period. It's a very
 

1547
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,349
decades during this period. It's a very
dangerous ongoing conflict.

1548
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:57,359
dangerous ongoing conflict.
 

1549
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,790
dangerous ongoing conflict.
because it is very unjust

1550
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:00,800
because it is very unjust
 

1551
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,150
because it is very unjust
and Israel needs to use more and more

1552
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,160
and Israel needs to use more and more
 

1553
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,470
and Israel needs to use more and more
force in order to repress the

1554
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
force in order to repress the
 

1555
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,430
force in order to repress the
aspirations of the Palestinian people.

1556
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:11,440
aspirations of the Palestinian people.
 

1557
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,069
aspirations of the Palestinian people.
And the more force that Israel uses, the

1558
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:14,079
And the more force that Israel uses, the
 

1559
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,510
And the more force that Israel uses, the
more resistance there is. And we've

1560
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
more resistance there is. And we've
 

1561
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,670
more resistance there is. And we've
reached a point of violence that is

1562
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:19,680
reached a point of violence that is
 

1563
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,190
reached a point of violence that is
unprecedented

1564
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,200
unprecedented
 

1565
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,670
unprecedented
in modern times. Israel is committing a

1566
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:23,680
in modern times. Israel is committing a
 

1567
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,349
in modern times. Israel is committing a
genocide in Gaza right now, which is one

1568
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:27,359
genocide in Gaza right now, which is one
 

1569
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,630
genocide in Gaza right now, which is one
part of the Palestinian lands. And every

1570
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:30,640
part of the Palestinian lands. And every
 

1571
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,270
part of the Palestinian lands. And every
day they're slaughtering tens or

1572
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,280
day they're slaughtering tens or
 

1573
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,470
day they're slaughtering tens or
hundreds of innocent people with open

hundreds of innocent people with open
 

1575
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,030
hundreds of innocent people with open
fire. And today there was another

1735
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,069
powers like Pakistan.
So even if it doesn't have its own

1736
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
So even if it doesn't have its own
 

1737
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,470
So even if it doesn't have its own
nuclear weapons, maybe Pakistan will

1738
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:00,480
nuclear weapons, maybe Pakistan will
 

1739
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,710
nuclear weapons, maybe Pakistan will
give it nuclear weapons. Maybe Pakistan

1740
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:02,720
give it nuclear weapons. Maybe Pakistan
 

1741
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,950
give it nuclear weapons. Maybe Pakistan
would defend Iran if there was a

1742
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:04,960
would defend Iran if there was a
 

1743
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,030
would defend Iran if there was a
full-fledged war with Israel. So this is

1744
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,040
full-fledged war with Israel. So this is
 

1745
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,150
full-fledged war with Israel. So this is
the second region where imperial

1746
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:12,160
the second region where imperial
 

1747
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,870
the second region where imperial
mentality lasts until today. The US is

1748
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:16,880
mentality lasts until today. The US is
 

1749
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,390
mentality lasts until today. The US is
unwilling to compromise on the imperial

1750
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:20,400
unwilling to compromise on the imperial
 

1751
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,150
unwilling to compromise on the imperial
prerogatives.

1752
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,160
prerogatives.
 

1753
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,710
prerogatives.
So the final uh point that I want to

1754
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720
So the final uh point that I want to
 

1755
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,309
So the final uh point that I want to
raise and then close is the US China

1756
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
raise and then close is the US China
 

1757
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,430
raise and then close is the US China
confrontation and how dangerous it is.

1758
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:33,440
confrontation and how dangerous it is.
 

1759
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,870
confrontation and how dangerous it is.
As I said, the US got along well with

1760
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:36,880
As I said, the US got along well with
 

1761
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,950
As I said, the US got along well with
China from the 1970s

1762
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:40,960
China from the 1970s
 

1763
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,829
China from the 1970s
to around 2010 in my estimation because

1764
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
to around 2010 in my estimation because
 

1765
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,069
to around 2010 in my estimation because
China was viewed by America as poor.

1766
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:50,079
China was viewed by America as poor.
 

1767
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,030
China was viewed by America as poor.
lots of villages that grew rice.

1768
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,040
lots of villages that grew rice.
 

1769
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,790
lots of villages that grew rice.
You could make uh our components for our

1770
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
You could make uh our components for our
 

1771
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,710
You could make uh our components for our
products, make our smartphones

1772
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:00,720
products, make our smartphones
 

1773
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,670
products, make our smartphones
uh and so forth, but China wasn't a

1774
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:03,680
uh and so forth, but China wasn't a
 

1775
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,109
uh and so forth, but China wasn't a
threat. And it was a good counterweight

1776
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:07,119
threat. And it was a good counterweight
 

1777
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,069
threat. And it was a good counterweight
to the Soviet Union or to Russia. That

1778
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
to the Soviet Union or to Russia. That
 

1779
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,589
to the Soviet Union or to Russia. That
was the attitude. Not too much more. So,

1780
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:13,599
was the attitude. Not too much more. So,
 

1781
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,790
was the attitude. Not too much more. So,
not too much attention given and not too

1782
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:16,800
not too much attention given and not too
 

1783
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,630
not too much attention given and not too
much concern. and ideology played no

1784
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,640
much concern. and ideology played no
 

1785
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,630
much concern. and ideology played no
concern because during the cultural

1786
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:24,640
concern because during the cultural
 

1787
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,790
concern because during the cultural
revolution period

1788
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:26,800
revolution period
 

1789
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,510
revolution period
uh which was not exactly American

1790
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,520
uh which was not exactly American
 

1791
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,309
uh which was not exactly American
ideology this is when the relationship

1792
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:32,319
ideology this is when the relationship
 

1793
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,710
ideology this is when the relationship
was formed between Mao and Nixon

1794
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:36,720
was formed between Mao and Nixon
 

1795
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,670
was formed between Mao and Nixon
then came the opening and that was an

1796
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:39,680
then came the opening and that was an
 

1797
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,230
then came the opening and that was an
opportunity for investment and trade

1798
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,240
opportunity for investment and trade
 

1799
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,069
opportunity for investment and trade
that's fine but ideology played no

1800
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:46,079
that's fine but ideology played no
 

1801
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,710
that's fine but ideology played no
special role started ing around 2010,

1802
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
special role started ing around 2010,
 

1803
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,950
special role started ing around 2010,
the American leaders that were watching

1804
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:52,960
the American leaders that were watching
 

1805
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,069
the American leaders that were watching
this said, "Oh, this is China's getting

1806
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:56,079
this said, "Oh, this is China's getting
 

1807
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,190
this said, "Oh, this is China's getting
awfully big and uh rather successful."

1808
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,200
awfully big and uh rather successful."
 

1809
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,309
awfully big and uh rather successful."
And then I think two announcements by

1810
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
And then I think two announcements by
 

1811
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,430
And then I think two announcements by
China really opened up American eyes.

1812
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,440
China really opened up American eyes.
 

1813
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,150
China really opened up American eyes.
One was the belt and road initiative

1814
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,160
One was the belt and road initiative
 

1815
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,750
One was the belt and road initiative
which was suddenly an economic financial

1816
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
which was suddenly an economic financial
 

1817
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,790
which was suddenly an economic financial
uh infrastructure initiative that had

1818
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:16,800
uh infrastructure initiative that had
 

1819
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,829
uh infrastructure initiative that had
suddenly a 100 partner countries and the

1820
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:19,839
suddenly a 100 partner countries and the
 

1821
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,790
suddenly a 100 partner countries and the
US didn't have anything like that and

1822
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:22,800
US didn't have anything like that and
 

1823
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,630
US didn't have anything like that and
then the made in China 2025 program

1824
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:26,640
then the made in China 2025 program
 

1825
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,790
then the made in China 2025 program
which was a really brilliant initiative

1826
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
which was a really brilliant initiative
 

1827
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,829
which was a really brilliant initiative
of China to identify 10 major technology

1828
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:33,839
of China to identify 10 major technology
 

1829
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,950
of China to identify 10 major technology
areas and set policies to make a major

1830
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:36,960
areas and set policies to make a major
 

1831
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,069
areas and set policies to make a major
major advance in these areas. And this

1832
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
major advance in these areas. And this
 

1833
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,230
major advance in these areas. And this
is one of the most successful industrial

1834
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:42,240
is one of the most successful industrial
 

1835
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,950
is one of the most successful industrial
policies I know of in history, the made

1836
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:44,960
policies I know of in history, the made
 

1837
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,349
policies I know of in history, the made
in China 2025 because it really worked.

1838
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
in China 2025 because it really worked.
 

1839
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,430
in China 2025 because it really worked.
It really produced the EV revolution. It

1840
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:53,440
It really produced the EV revolution. It
 

1841
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,670
It really produced the EV revolution. It
really produced uh the digital

1842
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
really produced uh the digital
 

1843
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,470
really produced uh the digital
revolution here. It really produced the

1844
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
revolution here. It really produced the
 

1845
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,630
revolution here. It really produced the
renewable energy revolution. So it was

1846
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:00,640
renewable energy revolution. So it was
 

1847
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,069
renewable energy revolution. So it was
very successful, but it terrified the

1848
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:04,079
very successful, but it terrified the
 

1849
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,790
very successful, but it terrified the
Americans suddenly. So starting around

1850
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:06,800
Americans suddenly. So starting around
 

1851
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,270
Americans suddenly. So starting around
2015, the whole view changed almost

1852
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:11,280
2015, the whole view changed almost
 

1853
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,990
2015, the whole view changed almost
suddenly in the United States. The view

1854
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,000
suddenly in the United States. The view
 

1855
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,190
suddenly in the United States. The view
went from economic partnership to the

1856
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
went from economic partnership to the
 

1857
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,549
went from economic partnership to the
need to contain China, the need to do

1858
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:20,559
need to contain China, the need to do
 

1859
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,150
need to contain China, the need to do
something to slow down China's economic

1860
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,160
something to slow down China's economic
 

1861
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,829
something to slow down China's economic
advance. Okay, all of this is quite dumb

1862
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:27,839
advance. Okay, all of this is quite dumb
 

1863
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,870
advance. Okay, all of this is quite dumb
in my view. Uh you don't get ahead in

1864
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:30,880
in my view. Uh you don't get ahead in
 

1865
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,510
in my view. Uh you don't get ahead in
this world by stopping someone else. uh

1866
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,520
this world by stopping someone else. uh
 

1867
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,069
this world by stopping someone else. uh
and uh there's no reason to. You're not

1868
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:36,079
and uh there's no reason to. You're not
 

1869
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,589
and uh there's no reason to. You're not
going to be better off. You're not going

1870
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:37,599
going to be better off. You're not going
 

1871
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,109
going to be better off. You're not going
to be safe. Uh it's just a lose-lose

1872
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:41,119
to be safe. Uh it's just a lose-lose
 

1873
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,910
to be safe. Uh it's just a lose-lose
proposition if it's successful and it

1874
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:43,920
proposition if it's successful and it
 

1875
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,309
proposition if it's successful and it
probably wouldn't be successful in any

1876
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:46,319
probably wouldn't be successful in any
 

1877
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,670
probably wouldn't be successful in any
event. It started under Obama, by the

1878
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:49,680
event. It started under Obama, by the
 

1879
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,430
event. It started under Obama, by the
way. It didn't start with Trump. It

1880
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:51,440
way. It didn't start with Trump. It
 

1881
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,829
way. It didn't start with Trump. It
started definitely under Obama and the

1882
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:55,839
started definitely under Obama and the
 

1883
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,109
started definitely under Obama and the
uh Trans-Pacific Partnership idea, which

1884
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
uh Trans-Pacific Partnership idea, which
 

1885
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,309
uh Trans-Pacific Partnership idea, which
was the dumbest idea of trade policy

1886
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
was the dumbest idea of trade policy
 

1887
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,950
was the dumbest idea of trade policy
that I know of, which was to make an

1888
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:04,960
that I know of, which was to make an
 

1889
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,549
that I know of, which was to make an
Asian trade system without China.

1890
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:08,559
Asian trade system without China.
 

1891
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,190
Asian trade system without China.
How can you do that? China's the main

1892
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
How can you do that? China's the main
 

1893
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,390
How can you do that? China's the main
trade country for all of Asia. But the

1894
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:14,400
trade country for all of Asia. But the
 

1895
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,549
trade country for all of Asia. But the
United States had the idea, we'll make

1896
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:16,559
United States had the idea, we'll make
 

1897
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,750
United States had the idea, we'll make
an Asian trade system without China.

1898
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:19,760
an Asian trade system without China.
 

1899
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,950
an Asian trade system without China.
This is only in America uh could you

1900
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:22,960
This is only in America uh could you
 

1901
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,069
This is only in America uh could you
have such delusions. In any event, it

1902
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079
have such delusions. In any event, it
 

1903
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,030
have such delusions. In any event, it
started with Obama, it continued with

1904
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:29,040
started with Obama, it continued with
 

1905
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,030
started with Obama, it continued with
Trump and it also implicates Taiwan

1906
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,040
Trump and it also implicates Taiwan
 

1907
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,430
Trump and it also implicates Taiwan
issue. Of course, this is the most

1908
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:35,440
issue. Of course, this is the most
 

1909
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,430
issue. Of course, this is the most
dangerous flash point of all, maybe the

1910
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:39,440
dangerous flash point of all, maybe the
 

1911
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,829
dangerous flash point of all, maybe the
most dangerous in the whole world

1912
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:41,839
most dangerous in the whole world
 

1913
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,190
most dangerous in the whole world
because the American politicians because

1914
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:45,200
because the American politicians because
 

1915
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,270
because the American politicians because
of this mindset

1916
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,280
of this mindset
 

1917
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,990
of this mindset
do not know how to stay out of China's

1918
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,000
do not know how to stay out of China's
 

1919
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,510
do not know how to stay out of China's
internal issues. And so rather than

1920
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:53,520
internal issues. And so rather than
 

1921
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,030
internal issues. And so rather than
saying that's not our problem uh you

1922
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
saying that's not our problem uh you
 

1923
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,870
saying that's not our problem uh you
settle this peacefully but uh it's not

1924
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
settle this peacefully but uh it's not
 

1925
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,349
settle this peacefully but uh it's not
our issue, the United States of course

1926
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:03,359
our issue, the United States of course
 

1927
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,710
our issue, the United States of course
is providing large flows of armaments to

1928
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,720
is providing large flows of armaments to
 

1929
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,589
is providing large flows of armaments to
Taiwan. And the American political

1930
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
Taiwan. And the American political
 

1931
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,829
Taiwan. And the American political
leaders are talking openly about

1932
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
leaders are talking openly about
 

1933
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,790
leaders are talking openly about
defending Taiwan and militarily

1934
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:14,800
defending Taiwan and militarily
 

1935
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,510
defending Taiwan and militarily
defending Taiwan. If China said, "We're

1936
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,520
defending Taiwan. If China said, "We're
 

1937
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,309
defending Taiwan. If China said, "We're
going to militarily defend the state of

1938
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:20,319
going to militarily defend the state of
 

1939
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,230
going to militarily defend the state of
Missouri," or, "We're going to

1940
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,240
Missouri," or, "We're going to
 

1941
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,270
Missouri," or, "We're going to
militarily defend Texas or we're going

1942
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280
militarily defend Texas or we're going
 

1943
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,150
militarily defend Texas or we're going
to militarily defend California, it

1944
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
to militarily defend California, it
 

1945
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,910
to militarily defend California, it
would not play very well in the US." But

1946
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:31,920
would not play very well in the US." But
 

1947
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,870
would not play very well in the US." But
the US because of the imperial mentality

1948
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:34,880
the US because of the imperial mentality
 

1949
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,990
the US because of the imperial mentality
cannot put itself in China's position or

1950
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:38,000
cannot put itself in China's position or
 

1951
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,870
cannot put itself in China's position or
doesn't care to because the US can

1952
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:40,880
doesn't care to because the US can
 

1953
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,549
doesn't care to because the US can
determine what should be done. So just

1954
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:44,559
determine what should be done. So just
 

1955
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,589
determine what should be done. So just
to conclude, I view this issue as

1956
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:47,599
to conclude, I view this issue as
 

1957
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,270
to conclude, I view this issue as
extremely dangerous and peace actually

1958
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:51,280
extremely dangerous and peace actually
 

1959
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,190
extremely dangerous and peace actually
depends on the good sense of the

1960
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:53,200
depends on the good sense of the
 

1961
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,790
depends on the good sense of the
Taiwanese

1962
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:54,800
Taiwanese
 

1963
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,430
Taiwanese
leaders, which is fragile because if a

1964
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,440
leaders, which is fragile because if a
 

1965
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,150
leaders, which is fragile because if a
Taiwanese president were to declare

1966
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
Taiwanese president were to declare
 

1967
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,230
Taiwanese president were to declare
independence,

1968
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:04,240
independence,
 

1969
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,109
independence,
all hell could break out

1970
00:52:07,109 --> 00:52:07,119
all hell could break out
 

1971
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,069
all hell could break out
because the United States would not

1972
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:10,079
because the United States would not
 

1973
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,990
because the United States would not
necessarily have any responsibility.

1974
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,000
necessarily have any responsibility.
 

1975
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,470
necessarily have any responsibility.
And this is why the situation is so

1976
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
And this is why the situation is so
 

1977
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,990
And this is why the situation is so
dangerous.

1978
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:18,000
dangerous.
 

1979
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,230
dangerous.
And if Taiwan were smart, and my feeling

1980
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:22,240
And if Taiwan were smart, and my feeling
 

1981
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,510
And if Taiwan were smart, and my feeling
is Taiwan could end up like Ukraine,

1982
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:25,520
is Taiwan could end up like Ukraine,
 

1983
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,030
is Taiwan could end up like Ukraine,
destroyed

1984
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:27,040
destroyed
 

1985
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,510
destroyed
in between two uh fighting giants.

1986
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:31,520
in between two uh fighting giants.
 

1987
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,549
in between two uh fighting giants.
And if Taiwan were smart, the first

1988
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,559
And if Taiwan were smart, the first
 

1989
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,109
And if Taiwan were smart, the first
thing they should say is to the United

1990
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
thing they should say is to the United
 

1991
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,150
thing they should say is to the United
States, don't send us any weapons,

1992
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,160
States, don't send us any weapons,
 

1993
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,829
States, don't send us any weapons,
please.

1994
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:41,839
please.

please.
We don't want a fight here. We'll handle

We don't want a fight here. We'll handle
 

1997
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,549
We don't want a fight here. We'll handle
our own diplomacy across the Taiwan

1998
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:48,559
our own diplomacy across the Taiwan
 

1999
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,950
our own diplomacy across the Taiwan
Straits. Please quote don't defend us

2000

2001
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,510
Straits. Please quote don't defend us
because we don't want to end up like

2002
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:55,520
because we don't want to end up like
 

2003
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,870
because we don't want to end up like
Ukraine caught between two giant powers.

2004
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:00,880
Ukraine caught between two giant powers.
 

2005
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,069
Ukraine caught between two giant powers.
So I'll conclude here for our discussion

2006
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
So I'll conclude here for our discussion
 

2007
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,270
So I'll conclude here for our discussion
to say that the world really is

2008
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:07,280
to say that the world really is
 

2009
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,670
to say that the world really is
dangerous right now

2010
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
dangerous right now
 

2011
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,549
dangerous right now
because of this mindset on the one hand

2012
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:12,559
because of this mindset on the one hand
 

2013
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,750
because of this mindset on the one hand
that I've described in the US and at the

2014
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:15,760
that I've described in the US and at the
 

2015
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,030
that I've described in the US and at the
same time because of changing reality. I

2016
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:19,040
same time because of changing reality. I
 

2017
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,710
same time because of changing reality. I
want to end on an optimistic note. If we

2018
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,720
want to end on an optimistic note. If we
 

2019
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,069
want to end on an optimistic note. If we
can avoid conflict

2020
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:26,079
can avoid conflict
 

2021
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,510
can avoid conflict
because of the technological revolution,

2022
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:29,520
because of the technological revolution,
 

2023
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,359
because of the technological revolution,
we really could have a world of
