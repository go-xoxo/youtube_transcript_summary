00:00 Why thinking of entropy as disorder causes problems
01:25 The most fundamental question in all of physics
03:25 A key non-intuitive statistical result
07:14 A tool to help think critically
08:54 Why doesn't a gas compress spontaneously? 
13:01 Macrostates, Microstates, Entropy, & Second law of thermodynamics
15:44 Why doesn't coffee and milk spontaneously unmix? 
16:47 Why entropy is the arrow of time
17:44 Shouldn't THIS break the second law of thermodynamics?
19:55 Shouldn't Maxwell's demon break the second law of thermodynamics?
23:00 Why is entropy a measure of energy concentration? 
25:41 Shouldn't refrigerators break the second law of thermodynamics? 
28:00 Shouldn't life break the second law of thermodynamics? 
30:40 Fermi's paradox
