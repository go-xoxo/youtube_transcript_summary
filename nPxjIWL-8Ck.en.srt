00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
uh I was I wrote the book after uh
 

159
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,630
uh I was I wrote the book after uh
coming out of being chief economist of

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
coming out of being chief economist of
 

161
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,309
coming out of being chief economist of
the World Bank and I was looking at it

162
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
the World Bank and I was looking at it
 

163
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,589
the World Bank and I was looking at it
through a particular lens of developing

164
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
through a particular lens of developing
 

165
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,869
through a particular lens of developing
countries and uh I was writing and

166
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
countries and uh I was writing and
 

167
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,789
countries and uh I was writing and
saying you know those global

168
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
saying you know those global
 

169
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,030
saying you know those global
arrangements were unfair to developing

170
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
arrangements were unfair to developing
 

171
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,309
arrangements were unfair to developing
countries, emerging markets, they were

172
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
countries, emerging markets, they were
 

173
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,429
countries, emerging markets, they were
unfair to workers in America. They were

174
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
unfair to workers in America. They were
 

175
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,390
unfair to workers in America. They were
agreements that were based basically on

176
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
agreements that were based basically on
 

177
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,190
agreements that were based basically on
uh corporate interest and financial

178
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
uh corporate interest and financial
 

179
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,429
uh corporate interest and financial
interest in the advanced countries and

180
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
interest in the advanced countries and
 

181
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,550
interest in the advanced countries and
particularly uh in the United States.

00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
particularly uh in the United States.
 

183
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,189
particularly uh in the United States.
And uh I worried that a lot of the

184
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
And uh I worried that a lot of the
 

185
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,710
And uh I worried that a lot of the
economic analysis on which it was uh

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
economic analysis on which it was uh
 

187
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,270
economic analysis on which it was uh
predicated globalization

188
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
predicated globalization
 

189
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,950
predicated globalization
uh made no sense. Uh there were ideas

190
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
uh made no sense. Uh there were ideas
 

191
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,909
uh made no sense. Uh there were ideas
like uh trickle down economics, just

192
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
like uh trickle down economics, just
 

193
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,350
like uh trickle down economics, just
make sure the pie is bigger and

194
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
make sure the pie is bigger and
 

195
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,830
make sure the pie is bigger and
everybody's going to be better off. No

196
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
everybody's going to be better off. No
 

197
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,749
everybody's going to be better off. No
theory behind that. In fact, economic

198
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
theory behind that. In fact, economic
 

199
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,469
theory behind that. In fact, economic
theory said that opening up trade could

200
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
theory said that opening up trade could
 

201
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,629
theory said that opening up trade could
actually lead to lower wages of workers

202
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
actually lead to lower wages of workers
 

203
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,550
actually lead to lower wages of workers
in a bank's countries. Um they were

204
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
in a bank's countries. Um they were
 

205
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,950
in a bank's countries. Um they were
predicated on notions that uh free

206
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
predicated on notions that uh free
 

207
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,310
predicated on notions that uh free
movement of speculative capital would

00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
movement of speculative capital would
 

209
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,230
movement of speculative capital would
stabilize

210
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
stabilize
 

211
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,550
stabilize
uh the global economy. And it seems to

212
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
uh the global economy. And it seems to
 

213
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,469
uh the global economy. And it seems to
me pretty evident if you looked at

214
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
me pretty evident if you looked at
 

215
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,629
me pretty evident if you looked at
history that

216
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
history that
 

217
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,029
history that
capital slashes around in a very uh

218
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
capital slashes around in a very uh
 

219
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,990
capital slashes around in a very uh
destabilizing way. And they were

220
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
destabilizing way. And they were
 

221
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,590
destabilizing way. And they were
predicated on the idea that

222
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
predicated on the idea that
 

223
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,270
predicated on the idea that
uh if you opened up free trade, yes, you

224
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
uh if you opened up free trade, yes, you
 

225
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,430
uh if you opened up free trade, yes, you
would lose jobs,

226
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
would lose jobs,
 

227
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,230
would lose jobs,
but uh new jobs would be created. It was

228
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
but uh new jobs would be created. It was
 

229
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,189
but uh new jobs would be created. It was
a simplistic view about job creation

230
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
a simplistic view about job creation
 

231
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,870
a simplistic view about job creation
particularly in the context of

232
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
particularly in the context of
 

233
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,189
particularly in the context of
developing countries. We all now know

234
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
developing countries. We all now know
 

235
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,670
developing countries. We all now know
also in developed countries that uh

236
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
also in developed countries that uh
 

237
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,629
also in developed countries that uh
creating jobs is much more difficult.

238
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
creating jobs is much more difficult.
 

239
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,350
creating jobs is much more difficult.
And too often what I saw was that you

240
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
And too often what I saw was that you
 

241
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,310
And too often what I saw was that you
moved workers from low productivity

242
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
moved workers from low productivity
 

243
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,990
moved workers from low productivity
import competing sectors to zero

244
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
import competing sectors to zero
 

245
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,469
import competing sectors to zero
productivity unemployment. And now it's

246
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
productivity unemployment. And now it's
 

247
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,710
productivity unemployment. And now it's
not a way to create wealth and and make

248
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
not a way to create wealth and and make
 

249
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,070
not a way to create wealth and and make
people better off. So there's so many uh

250
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
people better off. So there's so many uh
 

251
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,309
people better off. So there's so many uh
aspects of what was going on then

252
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
aspects of what was going on then
 

253
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,629
aspects of what was going on then
that sort of foreshadow the troubles but

00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
that sort of foreshadow the troubles but
 

255
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,590
that sort of foreshadow the troubles but

uh Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address
 

473
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,670
uh Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address
of the people for the people and by the

474
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
of the people for the people and by the
 

475
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,829
of the people for the people and by the
people uh where it seemed to me that we

476
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
people uh where it seemed to me that we
 

477
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,310
people uh where it seemed to me that we
were having a government that was

478
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
were having a government that was
 

479
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,590
were having a government that was
reflecting that top 1% And that led to

480
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
reflecting that top 1% And that led to
 

481
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,230
reflecting that top 1% And that led to
my book, The Price of Inequality. And by

482
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
my book, The Price of Inequality. And by
 

483
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,069
my book, The Price of Inequality. And by
the time I finished that book, The Price

484
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
the time I finished that book, The Price
 

485
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,190
the time I finished that book, The Price
of Inequality, in 2012,

486
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
of Inequality, in 2012,
 

487
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,829
of Inequality, in 2012,
it was clear to me that we were uh

488
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
it was clear to me that we were uh
 

489
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,269
it was clear to me that we were uh
sewing a fertile field for a demagogue.

490
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
sewing a fertile field for a demagogue.
 

491
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,750
sewing a fertile field for a demagogue.
And I actually said that in the book, uh

492
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
And I actually said that in the book, uh
 

493
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,949
And I actually said that in the book, uh
a demagogue like Trump. Uh at that

494
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
a demagogue like Trump. Uh at that
 

495
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,870
a demagogue like Trump. Uh at that
moment I don't think I had any picture

496
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
moment I don't think I had any picture
 

497
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,870
moment I don't think I had any picture
of somebody

498
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
of somebody
 

499
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,590
of somebody
as dangerous as uh Trump. You know it

500
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
as dangerous as uh Trump. You know it
 

501
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,389
as dangerous as uh Trump. You know it
was outsider our vision but that there

502
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
was outsider our vision but that there
 

503
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,829
was outsider our vision but that there
would be a demagogue seemed to me uh a

504
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
would be a demagogue seemed to me uh a
 

505
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,230
would be a demagogue seemed to me uh a
very high risk.

506
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
very high risk.
 

507
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,230
very high risk.
So you have this crisis of capitalism in

508
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
So you have this crisis of capitalism in
 

509

political externalities, the political
 

539
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,590
political externalities, the political
risks that would entail from their

risks that would entail from their
 

541
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,269

choices.
 

543
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,230
choices.
Here's a question because you know,

544
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
Here's a question because you know,
 

545
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,509
Here's a question because you know,
you've been around a long time. You've

546
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
you've been around a long time. You've
 

547
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,590
you've been around a long time. You've
seen so many different characters and

548
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
seen so many different characters and
 

549
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,590
seen so many different characters and
personalities in politics. There's an

550
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
personalities in politics. There's an
 

551
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,430
personalities in politics. There's an
argument which is that the statesmen in

552
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
argument which is that the statesmen in
 

553
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,110
argument which is that the statesmen in
this country that had the shared

554
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
this country that had the shared
 

555
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,030
this country that had the shared
experience of the Second World War and

556
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
experience of the Second World War and
 

557
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,670
experience of the Second World War and
across Europe actually were terrified of

558
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
across Europe actually were terrified of
 

559
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,509
across Europe actually were terrified of
going back to something like that. And

560
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
going back to something like that. And
 

561
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,030
going back to something like that. And
there was just a shared understanding

562
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
there was just a shared understanding
 

563
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,470
there was just a shared understanding
that politics can get really nasty

564
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
that politics can get really nasty
 

565
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,710
that politics can get really nasty
really quickly and we need to avoid that

566
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
really quickly and we need to avoid that
 

567
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,230
really quickly and we need to avoid that
kind of that kind of volatility, that

568
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
kind of that kind of volatility, that
 

569
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,430
kind of that kind of volatility, that
kind of volatility, that kind of

570
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
kind of volatility, that kind of
 

571
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,230
kind of volatility, that kind of
downside. And as societies on both sides

572
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
downside. And as societies on both sides
 

573
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,470
downside. And as societies on both sides
of the Atlantic, we've lost that that

574
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
of the Atlantic, we've lost that that
 

575
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,030
of the Atlantic, we've lost that that
inheritance, that kind of collective

576
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
inheritance, that kind of collective
 

577
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,629
inheritance, that kind of collective
knowledge. Do you buy that? that our

578
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
knowledge. Do you buy that? that our
 

579
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,629
knowledge. Do you buy that? that our
sort of commercial and political elites

580
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
sort of commercial and political elites
 

581
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,110
sort of commercial and political elites
simply don't think about the possibility

582
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
simply don't think about the possibility
 

583
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,150
simply don't think about the possibility
of political chaos, collapse, regimes

584
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
of political chaos, collapse, regimes
 

585
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,790
of political chaos, collapse, regimes
falling, demagogues.

586
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
falling, demagogues.
 

587
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,389
falling, demagogues.
Uh I think uh for to a large extent I

588
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
Uh I think uh for to a large extent I
 

589
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,350
Uh I think uh for to a large extent I
think that's true. um you know we've had

590
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
think that's true. um you know we've had
 

591
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,710
think that's true. um you know we've had
so much political stability

592
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
so much political stability
 

593
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,829
so much political stability
uh and particularly after World War II

594
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
uh and particularly after World War II
 

595
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,550
uh and particularly after World War II
uh we had decades of shared prosperity

596
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
uh we had decades of shared prosperity
 

597
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,470
uh we had decades of shared prosperity
uh where

598
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
uh where
 

599
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,150
uh where
you know every group in the population

600
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
you know every group in the population
 

601
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,310
you know every group in the population
grew but those at the bottom grew more

602
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
grew but those at the bottom grew more
 

603
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,030
grew but those at the bottom grew more
and so there was a almost out of that

604
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
and so there was a almost out of that
 

605
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,350
and so there was a almost out of that
period a a belief in the American middle

606
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
period a a belief in the American middle
 

607
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,629
period a a belief in the American middle
class. is this is the world that I uh

608
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
class. is this is the world that I uh
 

609
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,949
class. is this is the world that I uh
grew up in. Um but then

610
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
grew up in. Um but then
 

611
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,829
grew up in. Um but then
I think we didn't fully appreciate what

612
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
I think we didn't fully appreciate what
 

613
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,230
I think we didn't fully appreciate what
began to happen uh in the mid 1970s and

614
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
began to happen uh in the mid 1970s and
 

615
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,350
began to happen uh in the mid 1970s and
the really strikingly with 1980 Ronald

616
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
the really strikingly with 1980 Ronald

Reagan neoliberalism
 

619
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,110
Reagan neoliberalism
and uh that was really a major departure

620
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
and uh that was really a major departure
 

621
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,509
and uh that was really a major departure
from that post

622
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
from that post

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,470

it did. And the result we had growing
 

641
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,670
it did. And the result we had growing
inequality, we had financial crisis

inequality, we had financial crisis
 

643

choices which kind of made this somewhat
 

695
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,670
choices which kind of made this somewhat
inevitable. Uh I think the problem

696
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
inevitable. Uh I think the problem
 

697
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,189
inevitable. Uh I think the problem
started earlier than Obama. I have to

698
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
started earlier than Obama. I have to
 

699
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,110
started earlier than Obama. I have to
say I think the problem started in some

700

say I think the problem started in some
 

701
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,269
say I think the problem started in some
sense even under Carter where the

702
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
sense even under Carter where the
 

703
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,790
sense even under Carter where the
deregulation began. Clinton continued

704
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
deregulation began. Clinton continued
 

705
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,470
deregulation began. Clinton continued
that big financial deregulation lowered

706
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
that big financial deregulation lowered
 

707
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,509
that big financial deregulation lowered
the taxes on capital gains which is the

708
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
the taxes on capital gains which is the
 

709
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,150
the taxes on capital gains which is the
major source of income for the very very

710
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
major source of income for the very very
 

711
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,509
major source of income for the very very
wealthy. So, uh, the tax policy that

712
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
wealthy. So, uh, the tax policy that
 

713
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,990
wealthy. So, uh, the tax policy that
increased inequality was part of, uh,

714
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
increased inequality was part of, uh,
 

715
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,470
increased inequality was part of, uh,
Clinton's agenda, uh, but, uh, by the

716
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
Clinton's agenda, uh, but, uh, by the
 

717
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,430
Clinton's agenda, uh, but, uh, by the
time of Obama, it was clear where we

718
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
time of Obama, it was clear where we
 

719
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,350
time of Obama, it was clear where we
were going.

720
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
were going.
 

721
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,350
were going.
No excuse. So, yes, in the end, I do

722
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
No excuse. So, yes, in the end, I do
 

723
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,550
No excuse. So, yes, in the end, I do
blame Obama in a couple ways. Um

724
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
blame Obama in a couple ways. Um
 

725
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,510
blame Obama in a couple ways. Um
first uh he did have one achievement and

726
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
first uh he did have one achievement and
 

727
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,669
first uh he did have one achievement and
that was Obamacare which is the health

728
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
that was Obamacare which is the health
 

729
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,110
that was Obamacare which is the health
care uh for

730
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
care uh for
 

731
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,669
care uh for
the large numbers of Americans who

732
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
the large numbers of Americans who
 

733
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,510
the large numbers of Americans who
didn't have health insurance. That was

734
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
didn't have health insurance. That was
 

735
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,990
didn't have health insurance. That was
an achievement. Uh it it had in the

736
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
an achievement. Uh it it had in the
 

737
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,710
an achievement. Uh it it had in the
design there were a number of mistakes.

738
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
design there were a number of mistakes.
 

739
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,549
design there were a number of mistakes.
One of the things I had advocated was um

740
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
One of the things I had advocated was um
 

741
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,669
One of the things I had advocated was um
what was called the public option. Uh so

742
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
what was called the public option. Uh so
 

743
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,830
what was called the public option. Uh so
if the private sector didn't uh do give

744
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
if the private sector didn't uh do give
 

745
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,990
if the private sector didn't uh do give
what people wanted and needed, there

746
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
what people wanted and needed, there
 

747
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,150
what people wanted and needed, there
would be a public option that was thrown

748
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
would be a public option that was thrown
 

749
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,310
would be a public option that was thrown
out under the influence of the uh uh

750
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
out under the influence of the uh uh
 

751
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,070
out under the influence of the uh uh
health insurance companies that didn't

752
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
health insurance companies that didn't
 

753
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,390
health insurance companies that didn't
want competition. And the fact that they

754
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
want competition. And the fact that they
 

755
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,150
want competition. And the fact that they
didn't want competition should have told

756
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
didn't want competition should have told
 

757
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,110
didn't want competition should have told
us something that they were afraid of

758
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
us something that they were afraid of
 

759
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,270
us something that they were afraid of
the public option.

760
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
the public option.
 

761
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,510
the public option.
But that was a important success

762
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
But that was a important success
 

763
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,270
But that was a important success
overall.

764
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
overall.

Uh but the way he uh handled uh the bank
bailouts, the failures in helping

going on.
 

1105
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,430
going on.
He then went on also to say things like

He then went on also to say things like
 

1107
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,310
He then went on also to say things like
uh businessmen seldom get together

uh businessmen seldom get together

1111
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,590
whether for marrynt or whatever without
a conspiracy against the public. So he

1112
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
a conspiracy against the public. So he
 

1113
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,669
a conspiracy against the public. So he
didn't think businessmen were out there

1114
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679
didn't think businessmen were out there
 

1115
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,990
didn't think businessmen were out there
to increase people's well-being and and

to increase people's well-being and and
 

1117
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,110
to increase people's well-being and and
he really worried about what we would

1118
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
he really worried about what we would
 

1119
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,669
he really worried about what we would
call today uh anti-competitive behavior.

1120
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
call today uh anti-competitive behavior.
 

1121
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,230
call today uh anti-competitive behavior.
uh he writes uh at another point uh that

1122
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,240
uh he writes uh at another point uh that
 

1123
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,470
uh he writes uh at another point uh that
when regulation is in the favor of

when regulation is in the favor of
 

1125
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,110
when regulation is in the favor of

workers, it is almost always for the
 

1127
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,430
workers, it is almost always for the
good, but not so when it's in the

good, but not so when it's in the
 

1129
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,789
good, but not so when it's in the
interest of corporations. He's very much

00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:48,799
interest of corporations. He's very much
 

1131
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,149
interest of corporations. He's very much
aware how corporations capture the state

But he also realizes how important it is

1140
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,039
But he also realizes how important it is
 

1141
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,190
But he also realizes how important it is
for workers

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:12,880
he goes on at at another point and talks
 

1149
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,430
he goes on at at another point and talks
about uh how

about uh how
 

1151

1155
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,269
always in secrecy to conspire to push
down the wages of workers. And I often

1156
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:27,279
down the wages of workers. And I often
 

1157
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,830
down the wages of workers. And I often
quote that passage when talking about

1158
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:29,840
quote that passage when talking about
 

1159
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,630
quote that passage when talking about
some of the conspiracies that went on

some of the conspiracies that went on

in some of the highest profitm firms.
 

1167
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,669
in some of the highest profitm firms.
They were

1168
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
They were
 

1169
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,190
They were
working together to lower the wages of

1170
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
working together to lower the wages of
 

1171

those who were generating their profits.
 

1173
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,230
those who were generating their profits.
I mean quite unbelievable. So there

1174
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
I mean quite unbelievable. So there
 

1175
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,389
I mean quite unbelievable. So there
there was a kind of foresight that he

1176
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
there was a kind of foresight that he
 

1177
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,870
there was a kind of foresight that he
had. Maybe it was about the basic nature

1178
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880
had. Maybe it was about the basic nature
 

1179
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,350
had. Maybe it was about the basic nature
of human nature and and the striving for

1180
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
of human nature and and the striving for
 

1181
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,549
of human nature and and the striving for
profits, but clearly he did not believe

1182
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:04,559
profits, but clearly he did not believe
 

1183
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,870
profits, but clearly he did not believe
in unfettered capitalism. Yeah. And he

1184
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:06,880
in unfettered capitalism. Yeah. And he
 

1185
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,430
in unfettered capitalism. Yeah. And he
he makes effectively prototrade union

1186
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
he makes effectively prototrade union
 

1187
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,789
he makes effectively prototrade union
arguments because he talks about

1188
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
arguments because he talks about
 

1189
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,230
arguments because he talks about
employers working in combination and and

employers working in combination and and
 

1191
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,070
employers working in combination and and
this is this is when trade unions are

1192
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,080
this is this is when trade unions are
 

1193
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,590
this is this is when trade unions are
well illegal. You get the tall puddle

00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
well illegal. You get the tall puddle
 

1195
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,909
well illegal. You get the tall puddle

this small group of workers in this tiny
 

1205
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,789
this small group of workers in this tiny
Dorset village. So I mean uh quite

1206
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
Dorset village. So I mean uh quite
 

1207
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,630

extraordinary how he's been abused and
 

1209
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,350
extraordinary how he's been abused and
misused. Why is that? And and was it

1210
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,360
misused. Why is that? And and was it
 

1211
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,870
misused. Why is that? And and was it
always like that? Was there some

1212
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
always like that? Was there some
 

1213
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,230
always like that? Was there some
political project to reassert that Adam

Smith was a certain kind of person?
 

1217
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,430
Smith was a certain kind of person?
Where does that come from? Because if

1218
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:45,440
Where does that come from? Because if
 

1219
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,110
Where does that come from? Because if
you just read the wealth of nations or

minutes, this stuff becomes evident
 

1225
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,789
minutes, this stuff becomes evident
quite quickly. Yes. Well, I think uh one

1229
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,830
way of trying to understand
uh how that came about was to realize

1230
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840
uh how that came about was to realize
 

1231
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,950
uh how that came about was to realize
that um

1232

people uh living standards went down,
 

1247
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,470
people uh living standards went down,
especially if you include the

you read Dickens, you you see the the
the view of how dire things uh were. So,

1256
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:41,919
the view of how dire things uh were. So,
 

1257
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,310
the view of how dire things uh were. So,
uh obviously,

uh were gaining,

1262
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
uh were gaining,
 

1263
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,269
uh were gaining,
uh and they wanted, uh a theory to

1264
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
uh and they wanted, uh a theory to
 

1265
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,909
uh and they wanted, uh a theory to
justify what was going on to defend it.

1266
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
justify what was going on to defend it.
 

1267
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,950
justify what was going on to defend it.
Um and a whole series of uh ideas were

1268
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
Um and a whole series of uh ideas were
 

1269
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,710
Um and a whole series of uh ideas were
put forward uh uh that I summarized and

1270
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:08,720
put forward uh uh that I summarized and
 

1271
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,430
put forward uh uh that I summarized and
called the the just desserts. The reason

1272
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:11,440
called the the just desserts. The reason
 

1273
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,149
called the the just desserts. The reason
the rich are rich is because

1274
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,159
the rich are rich is because
 

1275
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,909
the rich are rich is because
uh they deserve it. And what did that

1276
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919
uh they deserve it. And what did that
 

1277
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,950
uh they deserve it. And what did that
mean? Uh they worked harder, they were

1278
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
mean? Uh they worked harder, they were
 

1279
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,789
mean? Uh they worked harder, they were
more innovative.

1280
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:20,799
more innovative.
 

1281
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,269
more innovative.
uh Nassau senior who was uh uh the first

1282
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,279
uh Nassau senior who was uh uh the first
 

1283
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,750
uh Nassau senior who was uh uh the first
holder of the first chair in political

1284
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:27,760
holder of the first chair in political
 

1285
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,110
holder of the first chair in political
economy at Oxford which I held uh a

1286
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,120
economy at Oxford which I held uh a
 

1287
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,710
economy at Oxford which I held uh a
couple hundred years later uh said uh uh

1288
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
couple hundred years later uh said uh uh
 

1289
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,789
couple hundred years later uh said uh uh
um described uh the high income of

1290
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:40,799
um described uh the high income of
 

1291
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,110
um described uh the high income of
capitalists due to their abstinence a

1292
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
capitalists due to their abstinence a
 

1293
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,669
capitalists due to their abstinence a
word I loved that they didn't consume

1294
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:45,679
word I loved that they didn't consume
 

1295
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,750
word I loved that they didn't consume
and there therefore it was a reward for

1296
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:47,760
and there therefore it was a reward for
 

1297
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,590
and there therefore it was a reward for
their savings

1298
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:49,600
their savings
 

1299
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,590
their savings
um So uh that was one theory that all

1300
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:55,600
um So uh that was one theory that all
 

1301
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,230
um So uh that was one theory that all
this inequality don't be upset it's

1302
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
this inequality don't be upset it's
 

1303
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,990
this inequality don't be upset it's
really morally right. It is uh their

1304
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
really morally right. It is uh their
 

1305
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,590
really morally right. It is uh their
compensation

1306
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:05,600
compensation
 

1307
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,549
compensation
for what they've contributed the called

1308
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:08,559
for what they've contributed the called
 

1309
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,190
for what they've contributed the called
the marginal contribute uh productivity

1310
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
the marginal contribute uh productivity
 

1311
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,990
the marginal contribute uh productivity
theory and uh it it it it gave a

1312
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
theory and uh it it it it gave a
 

1313
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,630
theory and uh it it it it gave a
a sort of a morality

1314
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
a sort of a morality
 

1315
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,549
a sort of a morality
to this uh huge inequality that was then

1316
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:24,559
to this uh huge inequality that was then
 

1317
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,269
to this uh huge inequality that was then
emerging. The other theory of course was

1318
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
emerging. The other theory of course was
 

1319
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,070
emerging. The other theory of course was
that of Karl Marx. was based on

1320
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,080
that of Karl Marx. was based on
 

1321
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,669
that of Karl Marx. was based on
exploitation,

1322
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:31,679
exploitation,
 

1323
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,630
exploitation,
taking advantage of workers. Um,

1324
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640
taking advantage of workers. Um,
 

1325
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,190
taking advantage of workers. Um,
and so you had a contest between two

1326
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200
and so you had a contest between two
 

1327
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,430
and so you had a contest between two
different views of the world. Um,

1328
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440
different views of the world. Um,
 

1329
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,909
different views of the world. Um,
one saying

1330
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:45,919
one saying
 

1331
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,909
one saying
the capital system was very productive

1332
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:49,919
the capital system was very productive
 

1333
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,789
the capital system was very productive
and morally justified. The other was say

1334
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
and morally justified. The other was say
 

1335
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,870
and morally justified. The other was say
was based on exploitation and taking

1336
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:54,880
was based on exploitation and taking
 

1337
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,310
was based on exploitation and taking
advantage of others and would eventually

1338
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,320
advantage of others and would eventually
 

1339
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,389
advantage of others and would eventually
run into problems. Um and so in this uh

1340
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399
run into problems. Um and so in this uh
 

1341
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,710
run into problems. Um and so in this uh
debate uh Smith becomes one of the

1342
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
debate uh Smith becomes one of the
 

1343
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,830
debate uh Smith becomes one of the
protagonists for

1344
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
protagonists for
 

1345
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,710
protagonists for
uh the good capitalism.

1346
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
uh the good capitalism.
 

1347
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,789
uh the good capitalism.
Whereas I think from the perspective of

1348
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
Whereas I think from the perspective of
 

1349
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,750
Whereas I think from the perspective of
of today 21st century economics we can

1350
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:19,760
of today 21st century economics we can
 

1351
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,710
of today 21st century economics we can
see actually Adam Smith was the

1352
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:22,720
see actually Adam Smith was the
 

1353
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,870
see actually Adam Smith was the
reasonable person in the room. Uh he saw

1354
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:26,880
reasonable person in the room. Uh he saw
 

1355
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,149
reasonable person in the room. Uh he saw
that there were some uh uh benefits that

1356
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
that there were some uh uh benefits that
 

1357
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,789
that there were some uh uh benefits that
that there were this incentive system.

1358
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
that there were this incentive system.
 

1359
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,789
that there were this incentive system.
Uh but he also saw there was

1360
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
Uh but he also saw there was
 

1361
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,110
Uh but he also saw there was
exploitation and that's why you needed

1362
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,120
exploitation and that's why you needed
 

1363
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,310
exploitation and that's why you needed
government regulation. And he also saw

1364
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
government regulation. And he also saw
 

1365
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,350
government regulation. And he also saw
that you needed government intervention

1366
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
that you needed government intervention
 

1367
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,630
that you needed government intervention
for providing education. He saw a a

1368
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,640
for providing education. He saw a a
 

1369
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,789
for providing education. He saw a a
broader role of government in public

1370
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
broader role of government in public
 

1371
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,310
broader role of government in public
investment.

1372
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,320
investment.
 

1373
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,470
investment.
So in that way I see Adam Smith as being

1374
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,480
So in that way I see Adam Smith as being
 

1375
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,509
So in that way I see Adam Smith as being
very much a modern economist. you know,

1376
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:01,519
very much a modern economist. you know,
 

1377
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,909
very much a modern economist. you know,
not uh the pimacist on exploitation, but

1378
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
not uh the pimacist on exploitation, but
 

1379
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,990
not uh the pimacist on exploitation, but
somebody trying to get a a balanced

1380
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
somebody trying to get a a balanced
 

1381
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,070
somebody trying to get a a balanced
picture uh of the strengths and the

1382
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
picture uh of the strengths and the
 

1383
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,230
picture uh of the strengths and the
limits of a market economy. Yeah. Adam

1384
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,240
limits of a market economy. Yeah. Adam
 

1385
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,830
limits of a market economy. Yeah. Adam
Smith, I think to the modern mind is

1386
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,840
Smith, I think to the modern mind is
 

1387
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,269
Smith, I think to the modern mind is
probably center left if you actually

1388
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:19,279
probably center left if you actually
 

1389
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,909
probably center left if you actually
read the guy. Uh and Markx, you know, in

1390
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:21,919
read the guy. Uh and Markx, you know, in
 

1391
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,590
read the guy. Uh and Markx, you know, in
in his defense, I mean, he would call

1392
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,600
in his defense, I mean, he would call
 

1393
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,350
in his defense, I mean, he would call
himself an empiricist, but he was also

1394
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,360
himself an empiricist, but he was also
 

1395
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,870
himself an empiricist, but he was also
he was a pmacist, right? He was trying

1396
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
he was a pmacist, right? He was trying
 

1397
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,789
he was a pmacist, right? He was trying
to write a big political pmic at a

1398
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
to write a big political pmic at a
 

1399
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,630
to write a big political pmic at a
really important moment. And that wasn't

1400
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
really important moment. And that wasn't
 

1401
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,789
really important moment. And that wasn't
something um Smith did, but it's so

1402
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:32,799
something um Smith did, but it's so
 

1403
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,990
something um Smith did, but it's so
true. You know, you read somebody like

1404
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,000
true. You know, you read somebody like
 

1405
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,389
true. You know, you read somebody like
Thomas Mouthys and Adam Smith, I mean,

1406
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:36,399
Thomas Mouthys and Adam Smith, I mean,
 

1407
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,070
Thomas Mouthys and Adam Smith, I mean,
they're saying such wildly different

1408
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,080
they're saying such wildly different
 

1409
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,269
they're saying such wildly different
things. You know, Thomas Mouthus

1410
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:39,279
things. You know, Thomas Mouthus
 

1411
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,029
things. You know, Thomas Mouthus
basically says if children die because

1412
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
basically says if children die because
 

1413
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,149
basically says if children die because
they can't eat, that's life. So be it.

1414
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
they can't eat, that's life. So be it.
 

1415
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,669
they can't eat, that's life. So be it.
It's part of the equilibrium system.

1416
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
It's part of the equilibrium system.
 

1417
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,710
It's part of the equilibrium system.
Yeah. Yeah. And um the the idea that,

not just a question for the United
 

1575
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,589
not just a question for the United
States. It's the same in the UK and it's

1576
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:01,599
States. It's the same in the UK and it's
 

1577
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,349
States. It's the same in the UK and it's
not a recent phenomenon. Like you say,

1578
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
not a recent phenomenon. Like you say,
 

1579
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,310
not a recent phenomenon. Like you say,
Obama has the crisis. He wins this huge

1580
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,320
Obama has the crisis. He wins this huge
 

1581
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,990
Obama has the crisis. He wins this huge
mandate, like extraordinary number of

1582
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
mandate, like extraordinary number of
 

1583
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,710
mandate, like extraordinary number of
votes. Probably the most charismatic

1584
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:10,720
votes. Probably the most charismatic
 

1585
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,750
votes. Probably the most charismatic
American politician, I would say, since

1586
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
American politician, I would say, since
 

1587
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,430
American politician, I would say, since
Kennedy, but you could say Reagan, but

1588
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:15,440
Kennedy, but you could say Reagan, but
 

1589
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,950
Kennedy, but you could say Reagan, but
he's at that level easily. And yet he he

1590
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
he's at that level easily. And yet he he
 

1591
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,950
he's at that level easily. And yet he he
doesn't he doesn't deliver on a holistic

1592
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
doesn't he doesn't deliver on a holistic
 

1593
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,790
doesn't he doesn't deliver on a holistic
political project. And you see something

1594
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
political project. And you see something
 

1595
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,670
political project. And you see something
similar with Star right now in this

1596
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
similar with Star right now in this
 

1597
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,950
similar with Star right now in this
country. Again, you use the word

1598
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:26,960
country. Again, you use the word
 

1599
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,670
country. Again, you use the word
patchwork. That's precisely it. So why

1600
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:29,680
patchwork. That's precisely it. So why
 

1601
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,390
patchwork. That's precisely it. So why
don't progressive parties across the

1602
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
don't progressive parties across the
 

1603
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,349
don't progressive parties across the
anglophone world so far pursue the kind

1604
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:35,359
anglophone world so far pursue the kind
 

1605
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,790
anglophone world so far pursue the kind
of agenda you're talking about with with

1606
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:36,800
of agenda you're talking about with with
 

1607
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,349
of agenda you're talking about with with
FDR? What's stopping them? I think one

1608
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
FDR? What's stopping them? I think one
 

1609
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,390
FDR? What's stopping them? I think one
way of thinking about uh it goes go back

1610
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
way of thinking about uh it goes go back
 

1611
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,470
way of thinking about uh it goes go back
to the uh 1980s, 1990s. We went through

1612
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:46,480
to the uh 1980s, 1990s. We went through
 

1613
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,510
to the uh 1980s, 1990s. We went through
a period of the great moderation.

1614
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:49,520
a period of the great moderation.
 

1615
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,750
a period of the great moderation.
Um

1616
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:51,760
Um
 

1617
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,190
Um
you might say it was a period of

1618
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
you might say it was a period of
 

1619
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,190
you might say it was a period of
mellowess

1620
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,200
mellowess
 

1621
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,030
mellowess
of everybody trying to uh get together.

And FDR
looked at that moment and he said I have

transition. Uh it's a very different
 

1697
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,990
transition. Uh it's a very different
world. So it's not replicating the 19th

they would say Mr. Stiglets, Professor

1730
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
they would say Mr. Stiglets, Professor
 

1731
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,270
they would say Mr. Stiglets, Professor
Stiglets, um this is all a reasonable

1732
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:57,280
Stiglets, um this is all a reasonable
 

1733
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,349
Stiglets, um this is all a reasonable
analysis on FDR. I happen to agree with

1734
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
analysis on FDR. I happen to agree with
 

1735
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,349
analysis on FDR. I happen to agree with
you in fact but we live in a different

1736
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,359
you in fact but we live in a different
 

1737
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,230
you in fact but we live in a different
world now. Personal debt is much higher.

1738
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,240
world now. Personal debt is much higher.
 

1739
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,550
world now. Personal debt is much higher.
Sovereign debt is much higher. We've had

1740
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:06,560
Sovereign debt is much higher. We've had
 

1741
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,710
Sovereign debt is much higher. We've had
no growth for a really long like real

1742
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:08,720
no growth for a really long like real
 

1743
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,390
no growth for a really long like real
growth. We've had debt leverage growth

1744
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,400
growth. We've had debt leverage growth
 

1745
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,430
growth. We've had debt leverage growth
really since the global financial

1746
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:11,440
really since the global financial
 

1747
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,589
really since the global financial
crisis. We haven't had a growth model in

1748
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
crisis. We haven't had a growth model in
 

1749
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,510
crisis. We haven't had a growth model in
the US or the UK. People talk about

1750
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520
the US or the UK. People talk about
 

1751
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,190
the US or the UK. People talk about
growth under Trump. Look at the deficits

1752
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,200
growth under Trump. Look at the deficits
 

1753
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,550
growth under Trump. Look at the deficits
as well. Um it's you're not creating

1754
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:20,560
as well. Um it's you're not creating
 

1755
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,950
as well. Um it's you're not creating
like private sectorled prosperity in

1756
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:22,960
like private sectorled prosperity in
 

1757
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,030
like private sectorled prosperity in
that country. Same in this country.

1758
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,040
that country. Same in this country.
 

1759
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,190
that country. Same in this country.
Certainly not if you take out big tech.

1760
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,200
Certainly not if you take out big tech.
 

1761
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,230
Certainly not if you take out big tech.
So this is not the same as the 30s.

1762
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
So this is not the same as the 30s.
 

1763
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,750
So this is not the same as the 30s.
What what would you say to them between

1764
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:31,760
What what would you say to them between
 

1765
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,829
What what would you say to them between
the debt, zero growth, even the

1766
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
the debt, zero growth, even the
 

1767
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,430
the debt, zero growth, even the
demographics, right? We're much older

1768
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:35,440
demographics, right? We're much older
 

1769
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,030
demographics, right? We're much older
societies. So the constraints are

1770
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,040
societies. So the constraints are
 

1771
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,550
societies. So the constraints are
higher, the costs are higher with

1772
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,560
higher, the costs are higher with
 

1773
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,150
higher, the costs are higher with
regards to elderly care, healthcare,

1774
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,160
regards to elderly care, healthcare,
 

1775
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,190
regards to elderly care, healthcare,
etc. What would you say to them? Well,

1776
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,200
etc. What would you say to them? Well,
 

1777
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,430
etc. What would you say to them? Well,
first I would say look at we we we are

1778
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,440
first I would say look at we we we are
 

1779
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,150
first I would say look at we we we are
uh a more innovative society.

1780
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,160
uh a more innovative society.
 

1781
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,910
uh a more innovative society.
There have been enormous advances in

1782
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:53,920
There have been enormous advances in
 

1783
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,870
There have been enormous advances in
science. Uh

1784
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
science. Uh
 

1785
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,309
science. Uh
what is the basis of

1786
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:00,319
what is the basis of
 

1787
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,109
what is the basis of
why our standard of living today is so

1788
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:03,119
why our standard of living today is so
 

1789
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,829
why our standard of living today is so
much higher than 250 years ago? It's

1790
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:05,839
much higher than 250 years ago? It's
 

1791
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,630
much higher than 250 years ago? It's
basically science and figuring out how

1792
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:10,640
basically science and figuring out how
 

1793
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,750
basically science and figuring out how
to work together collectively

1794
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
to work together collectively
 

1795
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,030
to work together collectively
uh new forms of social organization,

1796
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,040
uh new forms of social organization,
 

1797
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,430
uh new forms of social organization,
large corporations,

1798
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:19,440
large corporations,
 

1799
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,030
large corporations,
uh

1800
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,040
uh
 

1801
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,109
uh
and within the broader sense of society,

1802
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:23,119
and within the broader sense of society,
 

1803
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,630
and within the broader sense of society,
checks and balances, rule of law, uh how

1804
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:26,640
checks and balances, rule of law, uh how
 

1805
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,349
checks and balances, rule of law, uh how
to make democracies work. And we've

1806
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
to make democracies work. And we've
 

1807
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,829
to make democracies work. And we've
learned a lot about when things don't

1808
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:31,839
learned a lot about when things don't
 

1809
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,670
learned a lot about when things don't
work. Uh what are the principles of good

1810
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:35,680
work. Uh what are the principles of good
 

1811
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,109
work. Uh what are the principles of good
governance and what are principles of

1812
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
governance and what are principles of
 

1813
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,270
governance and what are principles of
bad governings. So I would say in terms

1814
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
bad governings. So I would say in terms
 

1815
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,670
bad governings. So I would say in terms
of fundamentals, we're actually in a

1816
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:43,680
of fundamentals, we're actually in a
 

1817
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,670
of fundamentals, we're actually in a
much better position than we were a 100

1818
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:47,680
much better position than we were a 100
 

1819
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,750
much better position than we were a 100
years ago. Uh the question is how do we

1820
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:51,760
years ago. Uh the question is how do we
 

1821
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,550
years ago. Uh the question is how do we
use all that knowledge and uh channel

1822
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560
use all that knowledge and uh channel
 

1823
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,670
use all that knowledge and uh channel
that knowledge to make uh a more

1824
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
that knowledge to make uh a more
 

1825
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,150
that knowledge to make uh a more
prosperous society and prosperous for

1826
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,160
prosperous society and prosperous for
 

1827
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,550
prosperous society and prosperous for
not just a few but for most members of

1828
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:04,560
not just a few but for most members of
 

1829
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,390
not just a few but for most members of
our society

1830
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:06,400
our society
 

1831
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,270
our society
and uh in the end I think uh we've been

1832
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,280
and uh in the end I think uh we've been
 

1833
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,790
and uh in the end I think uh we've been
caught in a 45 year failed experiment

1834
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:18,800
caught in a 45 year failed experiment
 

1835
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,430
caught in a 45 year failed experiment
And to me the the answer is to break out

1836
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,440
And to me the the answer is to break out
 

1837
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,829
And to me the the answer is to break out
of the experiment. Recognize the

1838
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:23,839
of the experiment. Recognize the
 

1839
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,710
of the experiment. Recognize the
failure. The experiment of course is the

1840
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
failure. The experiment of course is the
 

1841
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,670
failure. The experiment of course is the
neoliberal experiment. Uh the idea that

1842
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:29,680
neoliberal experiment. Uh the idea that
 

1843
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,510
neoliberal experiment. Uh the idea that
free markets are going to lead to higher

1844
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:31,520
free markets are going to lead to higher
 

1845
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,309
free markets are going to lead to higher
growth that uh will be shared by

1846
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:34,319
growth that uh will be shared by
 

1847
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,270
growth that uh will be shared by
everybody through trickle down economics

1848
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:37,280
everybody through trickle down economics
 

1849
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,309
everybody through trickle down economics
uh and markets are on their own stable.

1850
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,319
uh and markets are on their own stable.
 

1851
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,710
uh and markets are on their own stable.
I mean all those hypotheses

1852
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
I mean all those hypotheses
 

1853
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,150
I mean all those hypotheses
uh we given them a good try and they

1854
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
uh we given them a good try and they
 

1855
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,349
uh we given them a good try and they
failed not just in one country but in

1856
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:49,359
failed not just in one country but in
 

1857
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,430
failed not just in one country but in
country after country. So to me with all

1858
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,440
country after country. So to me with all
 

1859
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,510
country after country. So to me with all
that knowledge

1860
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:55,520
that knowledge
 

1861
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,470
that knowledge
we we are on a better footing to begin

1862
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:00,480
we we are on a better footing to begin
 

1863
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,750
we we are on a better footing to begin
to create an alternative economic

1864
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
to create an alternative economic
 

1865
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,510
to create an alternative economic
system. Uh I don't think it's going to

1866
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:07,520
system. Uh I don't think it's going to
 

1867
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,589
system. Uh I don't think it's going to
be easy because in a democracy you have

1868
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
be easy because in a democracy you have
 

1869
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,990
be easy because in a democracy you have
to convince a lot of people and uh I

1870
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,000
to convince a lot of people and uh I
 

1871
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,430
to convince a lot of people and uh I
hate to use the word but they've been

1872
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
hate to use the word but they've been
 

1873
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,030
hate to use the word but they've been
brainwashed

1874
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,040
brainwashed
 

1875
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,230
brainwashed
uh for decades that this particular

1876
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:22,240
uh for decades that this particular
 

1877
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,270
uh for decades that this particular
system if you only gave it a chance this

1878
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,280
system if you only gave it a chance this
 

1879
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,670
system if you only gave it a chance this
system neoliberal capitalism would work.

1880
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
system neoliberal capitalism would work.
 

1881
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,589
system neoliberal capitalism would work.
But eventually they're becoming

1882
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:31,599
But eventually they're becoming
 

1883
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,750
But eventually they're becoming
disillusioned

1884
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
disillusioned
 

1885
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,230
disillusioned
and this disillusionment is

1886
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:38,240
and this disillusionment is
 

1887
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,270
and this disillusionment is
leading them to go to

1888
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,280
leading them to go to
 

1889
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,470
leading them to go to
authoritarian populism.

1890
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:44,480
authoritarian populism.
 

1891
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,589
authoritarian populism.
And uh you might say the good news uh in

1892
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:49,599
And uh you might say the good news uh in
 

1893
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,750
And uh you might say the good news uh in
this uh very dark hour is that Trump is

1894
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:53,760
this uh very dark hour is that Trump is
 

1895
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,510
this uh very dark hour is that Trump is
showing them that authoritarian populism

1896
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:57,520
showing them that authoritarian populism
 

1897
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,470
showing them that authoritarian populism
may not be a good answer for anybody.

1898
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480
may not be a good answer for anybody.
 

1899
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,150
may not be a good answer for anybody.
Yeah, it's it's interesting that the the

1900
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,160
Yeah, it's it's interesting that the the
 

1901
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,550
Yeah, it's it's interesting that the the
collapse of of neoliberalism and the

1902
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:06,560
collapse of of neoliberalism and the
 

1903
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,109
collapse of of neoliberalism and the
collapse of the neoliberal self is

1904
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:09,119
collapse of the neoliberal self is
 

1905
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,950
collapse of the neoliberal self is
something that you even see play out

1906
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:10,960
something that you even see play out
 

1907
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,390
something that you even see play out
with social media. So you might

1908
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:12,400
with social media. So you might
 

1909
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,270
with social media. So you might
highlight a market failure or a negative

1910
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,280
highlight a market failure or a negative
 

1911
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,670
highlight a market failure or a negative
externality, stuff that people like

1912
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
externality, stuff that people like
 

1913
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,950
externality, stuff that people like
yourself as economists have talked about

1914
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
yourself as economists have talked about
 

1915
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,550
yourself as economists have talked about
for a very long time and they'll say

1916
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,560
for a very long time and they'll say
 

1917
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,950
for a very long time and they'll say
that's socialism, that's immigration.

1918
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960
that's socialism, that's immigration.
 

1919
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,230
that's socialism, that's immigration.
Because of course it can't be the nature

1920
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:24,240
Because of course it can't be the nature
 

1921
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,150
Because of course it can't be the nature
of the economic system you're living in

1922
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,160
of the economic system you're living in
 

1923
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,390
of the economic system you're living in
because like that's self-correcting. It

1924
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
because like that's self-correcting. It
 

1925
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,550
because like that's self-correcting. It
finds equilibrium naturally and that's

1926
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,560
finds equilibrium naturally and that's
 

1927
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,910
finds equilibrium naturally and that's
the that's the fresh air we've been

1928
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:31,920
the that's the fresh air we've been
 

1929
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,589
the that's the fresh air we've been
embibing as a culture for a very long

1930
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:33,599
embibing as a culture for a very long
 

1931
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,510
embibing as a culture for a very long
time. And I and I think you're right.

1932
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
time. And I and I think you're right.
 

1933
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,510
time. And I and I think you're right.
That's precisely why the answer for many

1934
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
That's precisely why the answer for many
 

1935
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,790
That's precisely why the answer for many
people is is right-wing

1936
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:38,800
people is is right-wing
 

1937
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,309
people is is right-wing
authoritarianism. I'm going to stick

1938
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:40,319
authoritarianism. I'm going to stick
 

1939
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,069
authoritarianism. I'm going to stick
with the skeptic stance for one moment

1940
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:42,079
with the skeptic stance for one moment
 

1941
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,829
with the skeptic stance for one moment
though.

1942
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:43,839
though.
 

1943
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,270
though.
So, particularly in the UK context, GB

1944
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,280
So, particularly in the UK context, GB
 

1945
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,109
So, particularly in the UK context, GB

create a new system, but debt to GDP is
 

1951
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,670
create a new system, but debt to GDP is
about 100%.

1952
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:55,680
about 100%.

about 100%.
My personal taxes are quite high. Um, my

My personal taxes are quite high. Um, my
 

1955

debt just to go to university.
 

1959

debt just to go to university.
uh we have 120 billion pound deficit

1960
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:08,880
uh we have 120 billion pound deficit
 

1961
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,349
uh we have 120 billion pound deficit
last year. Our debt interest payments

1962
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:11,359
last year. Our debt interest payments
 

1963
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,910
last year. Our debt interest payments
are 100red billion uh last year which is

are 100red billion uh last year which is
 

1965
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,349
are 100red billion uh last year which is
you know really really high by UK

1966
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:15,359
you know really really high by UK
 

1967
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,150
you know really really high by UK
standards. Where's the space because you

1968
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,160
standards. Where's the space because you
 

1969
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,349
standards. Where's the space because you
want to invest more for instance in

1970
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:19,359
want to invest more for instance in
 

1971
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,270
want to invest more for instance in
public infrastructure. Where's that

1972
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:21,280
public infrastructure. Where's that
 

1973
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,349
public infrastructure. Where's that
money going to come from? So what would

1974
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,359
money going to come from? So what would
 

1975
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,790
money going to come from? So what would
you say to them? Is it coming from tax

1976
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
you say to them? Is it coming from tax
 

1977
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,230
you say to them? Is it coming from tax
rises? Where would you cut stuff? So

1978
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
rises? Where would you cut stuff? So
 

1979
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,150
rises? Where would you cut stuff? So
first uh let me put it in a little bit

1980
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:30,160
first uh let me put it in a little bit
 

1981
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,430
first uh let me put it in a little bit
of historical context. uh when the

1982
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:33,440
of historical context. uh when the
 

1983
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,670
of historical context. uh when the
United States uh emerged from World War

1984
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:35,680
United States uh emerged from World War
 

1985
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,069
United States uh emerged from World War
II, we had a debt to GDP ratio

1986
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
II, we had a debt to GDP ratio
 

1987
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,230
II, we had a debt to GDP ratio
higher than we are today, significantly

1988
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,240
higher than we are today, significantly
 

1989
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,309
higher than we are today, significantly
higher. Uh we didn't let that stop us.

1990
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:46,319
higher. Uh we didn't let that stop us.
 

1991
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,470
higher. Uh we didn't let that stop us.
Uh the decades after that were our

1992
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:48,480
Uh the decades after that were our
 

1993
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,990
Uh the decades after that were our
fastest period of growth and that debt

1994
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
fastest period of growth and that debt
 

1995
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,510
fastest period of growth and that debt
GDP ratio went from around 100 over 130%

1996
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:55,520
GDP ratio went from around 100 over 130%
 

1997
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,430
GDP ratio went from around 100 over 130%
down to uh under 45%.

1998
00:47:59,430 --> 00:47:59,440
down to uh under 45%.
 

1999
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,069
down to uh under 45%.
If you grow the economy

2000
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:02,079
If you grow the economy
 

2001
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,910
If you grow the economy
then the debt over GDP goes down because

2002
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:05,920
then the debt over GDP goes down because
 

2003
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,390
then the debt over GDP goes down because
GDP goes up. Uh UK

2004
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,400
GDP goes up. Uh UK
 

2005
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,150
GDP goes up. Uh UK
the debt GDP ratio was even higher and

2006
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:14,160
the debt GDP ratio was even higher and
 

2007
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,030
the debt GDP ratio was even higher and
it then came down. Uh you had a harder

2008
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:17,040
it then came down. Uh you had a harder
 

2009
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,069
it then came down. Uh you had a harder
time. The war was worse for you. Uh you

2010
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:20,079
time. The war was worse for you. Uh you
 

2011
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,270
time. The war was worse for you. Uh you
had more destruction. uh we we just

2012
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:23,280
had more destruction. uh we we just
 

2013
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,030
had more destruction. uh we we just
postponed investment but you actually

2014
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
postponed investment but you actually
 

2015
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,150
postponed investment but you actually
suffered a lot. Um so that shows you

2016
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:32,160
suffered a lot. Um so that shows you
 

2017
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,349
suffered a lot. Um so that shows you
that that there can be a growth strategy

2018
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
that that there can be a growth strategy
 

2019
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,870
that that there can be a growth strategy
even when there's a high level of debt.

2020
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:38,880
even when there's a high level of debt.
 

2021
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,990
even when there's a high level of debt.
Now when you get push me on you know

2022
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,000
Now when you get push me on you know
 

2023
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,630
Now when you get push me on you know
what are the specifics I think there's a

2024
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:44,640
what are the specifics I think there's a
 

2025
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,549
what are the specifics I think there's a
lot of scope for increased taxes. I've

2026
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:48,559
lot of scope for increased taxes. I've
 

2027
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,150
lot of scope for increased taxes. I've
studied it very closely in the United

2028
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
studied it very closely in the United
 

2029
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,630
studied it very closely in the United
States. I know we have actually uh scope

2030
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:54,640
States. I know we have actually uh scope
 

2031
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,790
States. I know we have actually uh scope
for increasing our taxes over a 10-year

2032
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:56,800
for increasing our taxes over a 10-year
 

2033
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,950
for increasing our taxes over a 10-year
window, which is how we measure it, by

2034
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:58,960
window, which is how we measure it, by

the west learn from how China has
 

2129

itself as a market socialist economy
 

2137
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,309
itself as a market socialist economy
with Chinese characteristics. So you put

2138
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:32,319
with Chinese characteristics. So you put
 

2139
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,870
with Chinese characteristics. So you put
together that string of words and it

2140
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:34,880
together that string of words and it
 

2141
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,950
together that string of words and it
says uh we're different from any other

says uh we're different from any other
economy. Some people describe it as part

00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:42,079
economy. Some people describe it as part
 

2145
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,230
economy. Some people describe it as part
state capitalism. Uh but there is also a

2146
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:46,240
state capitalism. Uh but there is also a
 

2147
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,750

thriving

2148
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760

00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:03,200
they're saying no reason that we can't
 

2197
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,670
they're saying no reason that we can't
uh have as high a standard of living as

2198
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:05,680
uh have as high a standard of living as
 

2199
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,230
uh have as high a standard of living as
any other country.

2200
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,240
any other country.
 

2201
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,790
any other country.
And that opened up the window to try to

2202
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:10,800
And that opened up the window to try to
 

2203
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,950
And that opened up the window to try to
understand

2204
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:12,960
understand
 

2205
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,190
understand
uh what makes for economic success.

2206
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
uh what makes for economic success.
 

2207
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,349
uh what makes for economic success.
And they talked to everybody on the left

2208
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:19,359
And they talked to everybody on the left
 

2209
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,470
And they talked to everybody on the left
and the right. My first uh uh meeting

2210
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:22,480
and the right. My first uh uh meeting
 

2211
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,589
and the right. My first uh uh meeting
with them was in 1980. Uh my first visit

2212
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:25,599
with them was in 1980. Uh my first visit
 

2213
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,829
with them was in 1980. Uh my first visit
was in 1981.

2214
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:27,839
was in 1981.
 

2215
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:31,109
was in 1981.
Uh and you know continuing discussions.

2216
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:31,119
Uh and you know continuing discussions.
 

2217
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,190
Uh and you know continuing discussions.
They wanted to learn from any source

2218
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,200
They wanted to learn from any source
 

2219
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,750
They wanted to learn from any source
they could find and they listened to

2220
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:35,760
they could find and they listened to
 

2221
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,230
they could find and they listened to
different views and then integrated it

2222
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,240
different views and then integrated it
 

2223
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,109
different views and then integrated it
to the within their own framework. Um

2224
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:43,119
to the within their own framework. Um
 

2225
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,829
to the within their own framework. Um
out of that came a lot of novel ideas,

2226
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:47,839
out of that came a lot of novel ideas,
 

2227
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:50,309
out of that came a lot of novel ideas,
innovative ideas. I I don't have time to

2228
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
innovative ideas. I I don't have time to
 

2229
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,190
innovative ideas. I I don't have time to
describe it now, but one of the things

2230
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:53,200
describe it now, but one of the things
 

2231
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,349
describe it now, but one of the things
uh might be obvious uh investment in

2232
00:53:57,349 --> 00:53:57,359
uh might be obvious uh investment in
 

2233
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,870
uh might be obvious uh investment in
people, human capital, and they sent

2234
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:00,880
people, human capital, and they sent
 

2235
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,349
people, human capital, and they sent
hundreds of thousands of people to the

2236
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:03,359
hundreds of thousands of people to the
 

2237
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,510
hundreds of thousands of people to the
United States and to Europe, to

United States and to Europe, to
 

2239
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,910
United States and to Europe, to
Australia

2240
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:07,920
Australia
 

2241
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,870
Australia
to learn, to higher education, to be

engineers.
 

2245
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,309
engineers.
And you see the fruits of that.

2246
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:16,319
And you see the fruits of that.
 

2247
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,390
And you see the fruits of that.
A few weeks ago, I was in China. I saw

2248
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:20,400
A few weeks ago, I was in China. I saw
 

2249
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,349
A few weeks ago, I was in China. I saw
uh one of their new car factories. Uh

2250
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:23,359
uh one of their new car factories. Uh
 

2251
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,309
uh one of their new car factories. Uh
Robux putting together cars. Very few

2252
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:26,319
Robux putting together cars. Very few
 

2253
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:30,230
Robux putting together cars. Very few
humans in it. Uh

2254
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:30,240
humans in it. Uh
 

2255
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,270
humans in it. Uh
just amazing. And most of the employees

2256
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:35,280
just amazing. And most of the employees
 

2257
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,710
just amazing. And most of the employees
are not production workers, they're

2258
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:36,720
are not production workers, they're
 

2259
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,630
are not production workers, they're
engineers.

2260
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
engineers.
 

2261
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,430
engineers.
And that in they've gone from having you

2262
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:41,440
And that in they've gone from having you
 

2263
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,190
And that in they've gone from having you
might say a comparative advantage in

2264
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:43,200
might say a comparative advantage in
 

2265
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,349
might say a comparative advantage in
unskilled labor to having a comparative

2266
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
unskilled labor to having a comparative
 

2267
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,990
unskilled labor to having a comparative
advantage in engineering and skilled

2268
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
advantage in engineering and skilled
 

2269
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,910
advantage in engineering and skilled
labor. Remarkable change in 45 years.

2270
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:53,920
labor. Remarkable change in 45 years.
 

2271
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,430
labor. Remarkable change in 45 years.
And that's a third aspect of uh they did

2272
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,440
And that's a third aspect of uh they did
 

2273
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,430
And that's a third aspect of uh they did
some planning some thinking ahead. How

2274
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,440
some planning some thinking ahead. How
 

2275
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,549
some planning some thinking ahead. How
do you achieve this vision? And part of

2276
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:06,559
do you achieve this vision? And part of
 

2277
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,030
do you achieve this vision? And part of
that is industrial policy.

2278
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:09,040
that is industrial policy.
 

2279
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,670
that is industrial policy.
Now the United States finally is

2280
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:11,680
Now the United States finally is
 

2281
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,910
Now the United States finally is
beginning to embrace some industrial

2282
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
beginning to embrace some industrial
 

2283
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,430
beginning to embrace some industrial
policies in the chips act uh which uh US

2284
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:19,440
policies in the chips act uh which uh US
 

2285
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,829
policies in the chips act uh which uh US
recognized we didn't have the capacity

2286
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
recognized we didn't have the capacity
 

2287
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,470
recognized we didn't have the capacity
to produce a essential ingredient in

00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:24,480
to produce a essential ingredient in
 

2289
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,390
to produce a essential ingredient in
modern economy which is chips. Uh IRA

2290
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:28,400
modern economy which is chips. Uh IRA
 

2291
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,630
modern economy which is chips. Uh IRA
which recognized that we aren't prepared

2292
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:30,640
which recognized that we aren't prepared
 

2293
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,109
which recognized that we aren't prepared
to make the green transition.

2294
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,119
to make the green transition.
 

2295
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,630
to make the green transition.
Um,

2296
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:34,640
Um,
 

2297
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,270
Um,
but

2298
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
but
 

2299
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,349
but
we don't have a broader industrial

2300
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:39,359
we don't have a broader industrial
 

2301
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,510
we don't have a broader industrial
policy.

2302
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:41,520
policy.
 

2303
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,549
policy.
What Trump is is using trade as an

2304
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:44,559
What Trump is is using trade as an
 

2305
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,270
What Trump is is using trade as an
industrial policy. He wants to bring

2306
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:47,280
industrial policy. He wants to bring
 

2307
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,349
industrial policy. He wants to bring
jobs back to America. That's exactly

2308
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
jobs back to America. That's exactly
 

2309
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,829
jobs back to America. That's exactly
what industrial policy does. But the way

2310
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:51,839
what industrial policy does. But the way
 

2311
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,030
what industrial policy does. But the way
he's doing it is so thoughtless, so

2312
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:55,040
he's doing it is so thoughtless, so
 

2313
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,870
he's doing it is so thoughtless, so
uninformed, so destructive both to the

2314
00:55:58,870 --> 00:55:58,880
uninformed, so destructive both to the
 

2315
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,950
uninformed, so destructive both to the
United States but to the global economic

2316
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:00,960
United States but to the global economic
 

2317
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,589
United States but to the global economic
order that

2318
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:03,599
order that
 

2319
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,670
order that
it's questionable whether it'll he'll

2320
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:05,680
it's questionable whether it'll he'll
 

2321
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,750
it's questionable whether it'll he'll
achieve much and the cost in terms of

2322
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:09,760
achieve much and the cost in terms of
 

2323
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,109
achieve much and the cost in terms of
the global economy is going to be

2324
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,119
the global economy is going to be
 

2325
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,270
the global economy is going to be
enormous and in terms of the American

2326
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:13,280
enormous and in terms of the American
 

2327
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,390
enormous and in terms of the American
economy is going to be enormous. So

2328
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:16,400
economy is going to be enormous. So
 

2329
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,069
economy is going to be enormous. So
those are at least uh three aspects that

2330
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:20,079
those are at least uh three aspects that
 

2331
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:24,870
those are at least uh three aspects that
I think uh one uh can any country can

2332
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:24,880
I think uh one uh can any country can
 

2333
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,069
I think uh one uh can any country can
learn study uh from China. Now China has

2334
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:30,079
learn study uh from China. Now China has
 

2335
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,670
learn study uh from China. Now China has
some

2336
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
some
 

2337
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,109
some
advantages that uh other countries don't

2338
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:35,119
advantages that uh other countries don't
 

2339
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,190
advantages that uh other countries don't
have scale. Uh you know if you have 1.3

2340
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,200
have scale. Uh you know if you have 1.3
 

2341
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,910
have scale. Uh you know if you have 1.3
billion people you have a big market.

2342
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:41,920
billion people you have a big market.
 

2343
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,870
billion people you have a big market.
Having a big market gives you without

2344
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:44,880
Having a big market gives you without
 

2345
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,710
Having a big market gives you without
borders gives you some advantages.

2346
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:48,720
borders gives you some advantages.
 

2347
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,270
borders gives you some advantages.
So they are now in terms of purchasing

2348
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
So they are now in terms of purchasing
 

2349
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,990
So they are now in terms of purchasing
power parody which is the way economists

2350
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,000
power parody which is the way economists
 

2351
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,990
power parody which is the way economists
compare economies with different

2352
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:56,000
compare economies with different
 

2353
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,750
compare economies with different
