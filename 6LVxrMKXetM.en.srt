00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,270

Today I was looking at all of the the

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
Today I was looking at all of the the
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,990
Today I was looking at all of the the
banner headlines about the failure

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
banner headlines about the failure
 

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,430
banner headlines about the failure
yesterday uh in Alaska. The failure

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
yesterday uh in Alaska. The failure
 

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,470
yesterday uh in Alaska. The failure
because we didn't launch World War III

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
because we didn't launch World War III
 

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,190
because we didn't launch World War III
because the two presidents had a good

10
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
because the two presidents had a good
 

11
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,189
because the two presidents had a good
meeting together because they announced

12
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
meeting together because they announced
 

13
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,950
meeting together because they announced
progress. Uh this was is taken as

14
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
progress. Uh this was is taken as
 

15
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,269
progress. Uh this was is taken as
failure in our media which of course is

16
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
failure in our media which of course is
 

17
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,029
failure in our media which of course is

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,670
military-industrial complex in the
country. So, it's extraordinarily hard

28
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
country. So, it's extraordinarily hard
 

29
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,869
country. So, it's extraordinarily hard
to hear a word about peace in this

00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
to hear a word about peace in this

It's not so complicated actually to end

00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
It's not so complicated actually to end
 

35
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,630
It's not so complicated actually to end
these conflicts. It's a little

36
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
these conflicts. It's a little
 

37
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,270
these conflicts. It's a little
surprising how long it takes and how

38
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
surprising how long it takes and how
 

39
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,430
surprising how long it takes and how
hard it is uh to to accomplish this, but

40
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
hard it is uh to to accomplish this, but
 

41
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,670
hard it is uh to to accomplish this, but
it's not so hard in substance because

42
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
it's not so hard in substance because
 

43
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,109
it's not so hard in substance because
the underlying reasons for the conflicts

00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
the underlying reasons for the conflicts
 

45
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,670
the underlying reasons for the conflicts
that the United States is in perpetually

00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
uh are not sound reasons from the point
 

49
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,749

that we are in and those that we could

that we are in and those that we could
 

59
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,350
that we are in and those that we could
get in are misguided,

That's the basic point. It really is not

That's the basic point. It really is not
 

69
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,950
That's the basic point. It really is not
so complicated.

so complicated.

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,590

My poor family has had to listen to it

My poor family has had to listen to it
 

229
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,390
My poor family has had to listen to it
maybe a hundred times. I wrote a book

230
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
maybe a hundred times. I wrote a book
 

231
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,310
maybe a hundred times. I wrote a book
about it because I loved the speech so

about it because I loved the speech so
 

233
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,629
about it because I loved the speech so
much. I was a friend also of Ted

234
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
much. I was a friend also of Ted
 

235
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,390
much. I was a friend also of Ted
Sorenson whom I admired enormously. But

236
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
Sorenson whom I admired enormously. But
 

237
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,390
Sorenson whom I admired enormously. But
Kennedy made peace by praising the

Kennedy made peace by praising the

Soviet Union at the height of the Cold

Soviet Union at the height of the Cold
War, talking about their valor, their

culture, their scientific
accomplishments, and the fact that both

accomplishments, and the fact that both
 

247
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,950

Kennedy's

Kennedy's
 

257
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,270
Kennedy's
envoy Averil Heramman and said that's

258
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
envoy Averil Heramman and said that's
 

259
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,749
envoy Averil Heramman and said that's
the finest speech by a modern American

260
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
the finest speech by a modern American
 

261
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,909
the finest speech by a modern American
president. I want to make peace with

262
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
president. I want to make peace with
 

263
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,990
president. I want to make peace with
your boss. And five weeks later, the

264
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
your boss. And five weeks later, the
 

265
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,790
your boss. And five weeks later, the
partial nuclear testban treaty was uh

266
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
partial nuclear testban treaty was uh
 

267
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,070
partial nuclear testban treaty was uh
signed. And about four months after

268
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
signed. And about four months after
 

269
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,029
signed. And about four months after
that, uh in my opinion, the CIA killed

270
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
that, uh in my opinion, the CIA killed
 

271
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,629
that, uh in my opinion, the CIA killed
Kennedy uh for that and for other crimes

272
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
Kennedy uh for that and for other crimes
 

273
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,550
Kennedy uh for that and for other crimes
of uh trying to make peace. Maybe that

274
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
of uh trying to make peace. Maybe that
 

275
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,029
of uh trying to make peace. Maybe that
explains the military-industrial complex

276
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
explains the military-industrial complex
 

277
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,749
explains the military-industrial complex
as much as anything. Maybe our leaders

278
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
as much as anything. Maybe our leaders
 

279
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,710
as much as anything. Maybe our leaders
are just afraid. Uh they're afraid to

280
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
are just afraid. Uh they're afraid to
 

281
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,629
are just afraid. Uh they're afraid to
make peace. They're afraid to step out

282
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
make peace. They're afraid to step out
 

283
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,909
make peace. They're afraid to step out
of line. Maybe it is true, as some have

284
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
of line. Maybe it is true, as some have
 

285
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,390
of line. Maybe it is true, as some have
said, that since John F. Kennedy, there

286
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
said, that since John F. Kennedy, there
 

287
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,390
said, that since John F. Kennedy, there
hasn't been a president really that has

288
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
hasn't been a president really that has
 

289
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,589
hasn't been a president really that has
been an independent actor in the

290
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
been an independent actor in the
 

291
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,629
been an independent actor in the
American scene. I think it's an arguably

292
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
American scene. I think it's an arguably
 

293
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,150
American scene. I think it's an arguably
correct point. Nixon is a another

294
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
correct point. Nixon is a another
 

295
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,909
correct point. Nixon is a another
partial example, and he may have paid

296
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
partial example, and he may have paid
 

297
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,270
partial example, and he may have paid
the price as well by an inside job to

298
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
the price as well by an inside job to
 

299
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,430
the price as well by an inside job to
help bring him down.

300
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
help bring him down.
 

301
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,510
help bring him down.
I think it's arguable that they're just

302
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
I think it's arguable that they're just
 

303
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,070
I think it's arguable that they're just
afraid. If they're not afraid of that,

304
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
afraid. If they're not afraid of that,
 

305
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,870
afraid. If they're not afraid of that,
maybe they're afraid of Mossad.

306
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:46,880
maybe they're afraid of Mossad.
 

307
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,070
maybe they're afraid of Mossad.
Or maybe they're bought.

308
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
Or maybe they're bought.
 

309
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,029
Or maybe they're bought.
Or maybe they don't understand. Or maybe

310
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
Or maybe they don't understand. Or maybe
 

311
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,350
Or maybe they don't understand. Or maybe
they read the New York Times.

312
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360

 

313
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,469

It's a little hard to understand

314
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
It's a little hard to understand
 

315
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,589
It's a little hard to understand
why it is that we are in this mess of

316
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
why it is that we are in this mess of
 

317
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,430
why it is that we are in this mess of
war after war that cost trillions of

318
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
war after war that cost trillions of
 

319
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,950
war after war that cost trillions of
dollars

320
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
dollars
 

321
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,550
dollars
and that do nothing but worsen our

322

December 1991, or so we thought, and the

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
December 1991, or so we thought, and the
 

365

December 1991, or so we thought, and the
clock was reset at 17 minutes away from

Every president since 1991
has been in a period in which the clock

373
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,990
has been in a period in which the clock
has moved closer to midnight. I would

374

has moved closer to midnight. I would
 

375
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,990
has moved closer to midnight. I would
argue that every president since 1991,

Incidentally,

Incidentally,
without digressing, I had said the same

without digressing, I had said the same
 

515
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,990
without digressing, I had said the same

Then I got blamed for the lack of

00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
Then I got blamed for the lack of

stabilization in Russia by many people
 

539

though it was exactly the opposite of
what I had been saying because we

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
what I had been saying because we
 

543
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,110
what I had been saying because we
refused to provide any help whatsoever

544
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
refused to provide any help whatsoever
 

545
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,150

and honestly I could not quite figure it

out.

To summarize, the reason why is that the

00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
course, it would control the Middle
 

643
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,910
course, it would control the Middle
East, and it would do so on our tab and

644
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
East, and it would do so on our tab and
 

645
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,150
East, and it would do so on our tab and
with our military and with our support.

646
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
with our military and with our support.
 

647
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,629
with our military and with our support.
And so Netanyahu said, "We're not going

648
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
And so Netanyahu said, "We're not going
 

649
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,509
And so Netanyahu said, "We're not going
to make any compromises."

650
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
to make any compromises."
 

651
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,590
to make any compromises."
It's even a funny term if you know the

652
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
It's even a funny term if you know the
 

653
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,829
It's even a funny term if you know the
history of Zionism that it's a

654
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
history of Zionism that it's a
 

655
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,030
history of Zionism that it's a
compromise. Uh we come in, you should

656
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
compromise. Uh we come in, you should
 

657
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,870
compromise. Uh we come in, you should
leave, uh is is the basic summary. But

658
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
leave, uh is is the basic summary. But
 

659
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,550
leave, uh is is the basic summary. But
not even we'll divide the house. It was

660
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
not even we'll divide the house. It was
 

661
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,590
not even we'll divide the house. It was
your house. We'll divide the house.

662
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
your house. We'll divide the house.
 

663
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,910
your house. We'll divide the house.
We'll take 78%, you can have 22%. No,

664
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
We'll take 78%, you can have 22%. No,
 

665
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,150
We'll take 78%, you can have 22%. No,
we'll take 100% and there's a lot of

666
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
we'll take 100% and there's a lot of
 

667
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,910
we'll take 100% and there's a lot of
places you can move to. What are you

668
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
places you can move to. What are you
 

669
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,509
places you can move to. What are you
complaining about? You ingrate.

670
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
complaining about? You ingrate.
 

671
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,269
complaining about? You ingrate.
That's the basis of the idea. And then

672
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
That's the basis of the idea. And then
 

673
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,629
That's the basis of the idea. And then
the point is that a lot of people won't

674
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
the point is that a lot of people won't
 

675
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,110
the point is that a lot of people won't
like that. there will be uh there will

676
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
like that. there will be uh there will
 

677
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,230
like that. there will be uh there will
be a militant reaction and then

678
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
be a militant reaction and then
 

679
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,870
be a militant reaction and then
Netanyahu's idea is you don't fight the

680
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
Netanyahu's idea is you don't fight the
 

681
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,350
Netanyahu's idea is you don't fight the
militants, you fight the governments

682
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
militants, you fight the governments
 

683
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,230
militants, you fight the governments
that backed them. So we know of course

684
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
that backed them. So we know of course
 

685
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,669
that backed them. So we know of course
from Wesley Clark the famous story that

686
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
from Wesley Clark the famous story that
 

687
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,390
from Wesley Clark the famous story that
he visited the Pentagon a week after

688
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:22,400
he visited the Pentagon a week after
 

689
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,549
he visited the Pentagon a week after
9/11 and he was shown the list of the

690
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
9/11 and he was shown the list of the
 

691
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,510
9/11 and he was shown the list of the
seven wars in five years which was a

692
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
seven wars in five years which was a
 

693
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,669
seven wars in five years which was a
neocon Israel concoction combined. We're

694
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
neocon Israel concoction combined. We're
 

695
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,710
neocon Israel concoction combined. We're
going to take out all those governments

696
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
going to take out all those governments
 

697
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,669
going to take out all those governments
and that is Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran,

698
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
and that is Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran,
 

699
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,270
and that is Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran,
Somalia, Sudan, and Libya.

700
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
Somalia, Sudan, and Libya.
 

701
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,110
Somalia, Sudan, and Libya.
You know what? We've been at war with

702
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
You know what? We've been at war with
 

703
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,590
You know what? We've been at war with
all seven of them.

704
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
all seven of them.
 

705
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,430
all seven of them.
It didn't quite go to plan of seven wars

706
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
It didn't quite go to plan of seven wars
 

707
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,990
It didn't quite go to plan of seven wars
in five years

708
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
in five years
 

709
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,669
in five years
because we got bogged down in each one.

710
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
because we got bogged down in each one.
 

711
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,549
because we got bogged down in each one.
It didn't go to plan because it made a

712
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
It didn't go to plan because it made a
 

713
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,350
It didn't go to plan because it made a
wasteland of several thousand kilometers

714
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
wasteland of several thousand kilometers
 

715
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,750
wasteland of several thousand kilometers
from Libya to Iran.

716
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
from Libya to Iran.
 

717
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,549
from Libya to Iran.
But that's been a plan

718
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
But that's been a plan
 

719
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,029
But that's been a plan
and that's part of this same disaster.

720
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
and that's part of this same disaster.
 

721
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,630
and that's part of this same disaster.
It solves nothing. We have solved

It solves nothing. We have solved

It solves nothing. We have solved
nothing. And to this day, these

Honestly, these people are not clever.

Honestly, these people are not clever.
They're not clever.

Maybe already then.

But you could see the president is so

But you could see the president is so
everything about our media, about the

not, I don't know. But if he were a

00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
not, I don't know. But if he were a
 

1165
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,029
not, I don't know. But if he were a
communicator and had the guts and what

1166
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,039
communicator and had the guts and what
 

1167
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,870
communicator and had the guts and what
he should stand up and explain to the

American people, this was about NATO

enlargement. We're not going to do it.

enlargement. We're not going to do it.
 

1173
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,070
enlargement. We're not going to do it.
That would be the end. But he can't

1174
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
That would be the end. But he can't
 

1175
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,430
That would be the end. But he can't
quite he says it privately, I'm sure,

1176
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
quite he says it privately, I'm sure,
 

1177
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,230
quite he says it privately, I'm sure,
but not publicly. Why? Because we're

1178
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,240
but not publicly. Why? Because we're
 

1179
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,310
but not publicly. Why? Because we're
still trapped.

1180
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
still trapped.
 

1181
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,950
still trapped.
We're trapped as Eisenhower told us

1182
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:48,960
We're trapped as Eisenhower told us
 

1183
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,950
We're trapped as Eisenhower told us

we're trapped.
And all these think tanks up and down

1186
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:52,960
And all these think tanks up and down
 

1187
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,230
And all these think tanks up and down
the East Coast are bought the same way.

1188
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
the East Coast are bought the same way.
 

1189

It's all phony. Everything you hear

1190
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
It's all phony. Everything you hear
 

1191
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,510
It's all phony. Everything you hear
about the data. There was a report

1192
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
about the data. There was a report
 

1193
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,430
about the data. There was a report
recently about Russia's casualties being

1194
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,440
recently about Russia's casualties being
 

1195
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,750
recently about Russia's casualties being
x times that of Ukraine by

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:11,760
x times that of Ukraine by
 

1197
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,389
x times that of Ukraine by
one of the Washington think tanks. So I

1198
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
one of the Washington think tanks. So I
 

1199
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,389
one of the Washington think tanks. So I
looked at the

1200
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
looked at the
 

1201
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,549
looked at the
it was absurd. So I looked at the

1202
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
it was absurd. So I looked at the
 

1203
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,710
it was absurd. So I looked at the
footnote. Where'd that come from? The

1204
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
footnote. Where'd that come from? The
 

1205
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,549
footnote. Where'd that come from? The
footnote came from the uh Ministry of

1206
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,559
footnote came from the uh Ministry of
 

1207
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,029
footnote came from the uh Ministry of
Defense of Britain. I was already

00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:27,039
Defense of Britain. I was already
 

1209
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,350
Defense of Britain. I was already
suspicious. So then I went to the

1210
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
suspicious. So then I went to the
 

1211
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,310
suspicious. So then I went to the
Ministry of Defense of Britain and after

1212
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
Ministry of Defense of Britain and after
 

1213

a little maneuvering track down its
 

1215
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,070
a little maneuvering track down its
source. It was Ukraine.

1216
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,080
source. It was Ukraine.
 

1217
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,350
source. It was Ukraine.
Oh my god. They get paid for this. Of

Oh my god. They get paid for this. Of

Oh my god. They get paid for this. Of
course it's paid propaganda. Okay.

1220
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:43,919

1221
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,990
course it's paid propaganda. Okay.
Ukraine can be stopped when the

1222
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,000
Ukraine can be stopped when the
 

1223
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,310
Ukraine can be stopped when the
president of the United States says

president of the United States says
 

1225

publicly NATO will not enlarge. He could

publicly NATO will not enlarge. He could
 

1227
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,350
publicly NATO will not enlarge. He could
add parenthesis it was a bad idea.

1228
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
add parenthesis it was a bad idea.
 

1229
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,310
add parenthesis it was a bad idea.
If he wants, he could say, "It wasn't my

If he wants, he could say, "It wasn't my

And if there would be an invasion even

1406
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:39,520
And if there would be an invasion even
 

1407
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,750
And if there would be an invasion even
of Taiwan, which is a province of China,

1408
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:43,760
of Taiwan, which is a province of China,
 

1409
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,310
of Taiwan, which is a province of China,
it would be because the United States is

1410
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,320
it would be because the United States is
 

1411
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,670
it would be because the United States is
unilaterally arming Taiwan

1412
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,680
unilaterally arming Taiwan
 

1413
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,790
unilaterally arming Taiwan
against our diplomacy, against our

against our diplomacy, against our
 

1415
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,470
against our diplomacy, against our
treaties, against our 1982 communicate

treaties, against our 1982 communicate
 

1417
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,349
treaties, against our 1982 communicate
which said we would phase out arming

which said we would phase out arming
 

1419
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,630
which said we would phase out arming
Taiwan. The biggest risk we face is

1420
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,640
Taiwan. The biggest risk we face is
 

1421
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,790
Taiwan. The biggest risk we face is
turning Taiwan into Ukraine.

1422
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:06,800
turning Taiwan into Ukraine.
 

1423
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,990
turning Taiwan into Ukraine.
And we're way on the way to doing that

1424
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
And we're way on the way to doing that
 

1425
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,190
And we're way on the way to doing that
because the same
