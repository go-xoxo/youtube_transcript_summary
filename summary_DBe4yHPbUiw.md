## 🌐 What is a World War?  
- Not just many simultaneous conflicts, but **interconnected wars** affecting each other directly or indirectly.  
- Example: Russia's invasion of Ukraine ➡️ Israel bombing Iran ➡️ U.S. involvement ➡️ Taiwan Mainland invasion ➡️ North Korea attacks South Korea ➡️ India-Pakistan tensions.  
- Like dominoes falling, but with catastrophic consequences involving millions of deaths and nuclear risks. 💣☢️😱

## 🔥 How Do World Wars Start? (Wars of Opportunism)  
- Countries usually avoid war due to high costs & risks, maintaining tense peace. 🤝  
- However, when a major power is distracted or weakened, others may take **advantage of the moment** to act aggressively.  
- Example: China might invade Taiwan when the U.S. is preoccupied elsewhere.  
- Recent history:  
  - Russia distracted in Ukraine → Azerbaijan restarts Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.  
  - Russia's limited response in Syria → Israel attacks Iranian assets via Syrian airspace.  
  - Israel’s aerial war on Iran made possible by chaos in Syria. 🇷🇺🔥🇮🇱✈️🇮🇷

## 💣 Current Risks:  
- U.S. possibly entering Israel-Iran conflict.  
- Potential closure of Strait of Hormuz or attacks on U.S. bases.  
- Domino effects triggering multiple regional conflicts simultaneously (Korea, South Asia, Middle East).  
- This creates a **dangerous global cascade** toward a wider war. ⚠️🌏

## 🛑 How to Stop Wars of Opportunism?  
- The **key solution**: Increase defense spending within NATO to reach a "two-war construct" capability. 💰🛡️  
- Currently, NATO defense spending is about 2% of GDP; the proposed target is 5%.  
- This ensures countries can handle **simultaneous conflicts** and deter opportunistic attacks.  
- Historical context:  
  - During the Cold War, the U.S. maintained enough military power for two wars simultaneously.  
  - Post-Cold War erosion led to a fragile, one-war capacity.  
- The 5% GDP target also covers infrastructure and defense industry resilience to support long, attritional wars. 🏗️🔧

## 🤔 Why 5% Defense Spending Matters?  
- Not just more weapons, but **a credible deterrent** that imposes high costs on any aggressor.  
- Prevents the **domino effect** of one conflict triggering others.  
- Helps maintain global stability and avoid catastrophic wars.  
- Still uncertain if NATO heads of state will agree, but the situation urges urgent action. 💼👥📈
