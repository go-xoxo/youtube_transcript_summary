lot more body language we can talk about

538
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
lot more body language we can talk about
 

539
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,670

having won the peace. Both of these are
 

1303
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,070

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,909
knows that. But what Putin is quite
right. Trump is the only possibility

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,750
Beyond breaking. It's beyond me to say
that Trump said, "I've had enough of

1740
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:43,760
that Trump said, "I've had enough of
 

1741
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,829
that Trump said, "I've had enough of
this. Let's go home. We've agreed. I've

1742
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:47,839
this. Let's go home. We've agreed. I've
 

1743
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,190
this. Let's go home. We've agreed. I've
listened to the guy. We'll have a nice

1744
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:51,200
listened to the guy. We'll have a nice
 

1745
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,510
listened to the guy. We'll have a nice
think, but I don't need anymore. I don't

1746
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:53,520
think, but I don't need anymore. I don't
 

1747
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,309
think, but I don't need anymore. I don't
want to have lunch in Anchorage. I don't

1748
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:56,319
want to have lunch in Anchorage. I don't
 

1749
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,030
want to have lunch in Anchorage. I don't
need mying officials. If they want to

1750
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
need mying officials. If they want to
 

1751
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,030
need mying officials. If they want to
make money, let them exchange their

1752
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040
make money, let them exchange their
 

1753
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,510
make money, let them exchange their
bribes. Let them enrich my son on the

1754
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,520
bribes. Let them enrich my son on the
 

1755
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,390
bribes. Let them enrich my son on the
crypto companies on in in Dubai. All of

1756
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,400
crypto companies on in in Dubai. All of
 

1757
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,630
crypto companies on in in Dubai. All of
that's out of here. I'm going home.

1758
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:08,640
that's out of here. I'm going home.
 

1759
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,990
that's out of here. I'm going home.
Bingo. This thing ends in in in top

1760
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,000
Bingo. This thing ends in in in top
 

1761
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,150
Bingo. This thing ends in in in top
speed. Why? Because it was a test from a

1762
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,160
speed. Why? Because it was a test from a
 

1763
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,630
speed. Why? Because it was a test from a
Russian side of what Trump could hear.

1764
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:20,640
Russian side of what Trump could hear.
 

1765
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,750
Russian side of what Trump could hear.
It was a test for Trump of what Putin

1766
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760
It was a test for Trump of what Putin
 

1767
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,829
It was a test for Trump of what Putin
would say and it was a test from Trump's

1768
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:27,839
would say and it was a test from Trump's
 

1769
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,950
would say and it was a test from Trump's
point of view. Were the Russians to be

1770
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:30,960
point of view. Were the Russians to be
 

1771
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,670
point of view. Were the Russians to be
relied on not to defeat the US in the

1772
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
relied on not to defeat the US in the
 

1773
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,630
relied on not to defeat the US in the
Ukraine? That's what he cares about. He

1774
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:38,640
Ukraine? That's what he cares about. He
 

1775
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,230
Ukraine? That's what he cares about. He
doesn't want to see be the responsible

1776
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,240
doesn't want to see be the responsible
 

1777
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,430
doesn't want to see be the responsible
president for an abandonment of Saigon.

1778
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,440
president for an abandonment of Saigon.
 

1779
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,670
president for an abandonment of Saigon.
He doesn't want to be the president for

1780
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:47,680
He doesn't want to be the president for
 

1781
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,309
He doesn't want to be the president for
the abandonment of Kabell. He wants the

1782
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:50,319
the abandonment of Kabell. He wants the
 

1783
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,710
the abandonment of Kabell. He wants the
Europeans, if they're stupid enough to

1784
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:52,720
Europeans, if they're stupid enough to
 

1785
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,230
Europeans, if they're stupid enough to
pay Trump to lose this war, he wants

1786
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,240
pay Trump to lose this war, he wants
 

1787
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,030
pay Trump to lose this war, he wants
them to blame to be blamed for

1788
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,040
them to blame to be blamed for
 

1789
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,069
them to blame to be blamed for
themselves. And so he sent Vance. Why

1790
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:02,079
themselves. And so he sent Vance. Why
 

1791
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,390
themselves. And so he sent Vance. Why
isn't Vance there? Vance has been there

1792
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:04,400
isn't Vance there? Vance has been there
 

1793
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,470
isn't Vance there? Vance has been there
and was announced to be the head of the

1794
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:06,480
and was announced to be the head of the
 

1795

and was announced to be the head of the
delegation supporting Trump uh in the

00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,520
delegation supporting Trump uh in the
 

1797
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,670
delegation supporting Trump uh in the
American press. He wasn't there. And

1798
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:11,680
American press. He wasn't there. And
 

1799
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,390
American press. He wasn't there. And
nobody in the American press dains to

1800
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400
nobody in the American press dains to
 

1801
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,150
nobody in the American press dains to
tell us why he wasn't. Well, you know

1802
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,160
tell us why he wasn't. Well, you know
 

1803
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,230
tell us why he wasn't. Well, you know
where he was? He was quotes having a

1804
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,240
where he was? He was quotes having a
 

1805
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,190
where he was? He was quotes having a
fishing holiday in the Cotswwells with

1806
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200
fishing holiday in the Cotswwells with
 

1807
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,150
fishing holiday in the Cotswwells with
the foreign minister Lami.

1808
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,160
the foreign minister Lami.
 

1809
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,589
the foreign minister Lami.
That's not exactly a holiday,

1810
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:27,599
That's not exactly a holiday,
 

1811
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,750
That's not exactly a holiday,
right? So what Vance is doing Go on.

1812
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:31,760
right? So what Vance is doing Go on.
 

1813
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,510
right? So what Vance is doing Go on.
Oh, no. I Please, please continue your

1814
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:33,520
Oh, no. I Please, please continue your
 

1815
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,030
Oh, no. I Please, please continue your
thought about Vance and I just want to

1816
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
thought about Vance and I just want to
 

1817
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,550
thought about Vance and I just want to
in my my reading of it is that Vance's

1818
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,560
in my my reading of it is that Vance's
 

1819
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,829
in my my reading of it is that Vance's
job is the important one. He doesn't

1820
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:41,839
job is the important one. He doesn't
 

1821
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,990
job is the important one. He doesn't
have to sit and listen. He can listen a

1822
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,000
have to sit and listen. He can listen a
 

1823
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,030
have to sit and listen. He can listen a
bit longer than Trump. That was Trump's

1824
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,040
bit longer than Trump. That was Trump's
 

1825
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,150
bit longer than Trump. That was Trump's
problem. He had to sit and listen.

1826
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,160
problem. He had to sit and listen.
 

1827
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,790
problem. He had to sit and listen.
Okay. Right. The Russian people can sit

1828
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:52,800
Okay. Right. The Russian people can sit
 

1829
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,670
Okay. Right. The Russian people can sit
and listen to to Put in for four hours

1830
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
and listen to to Put in for four hours
 

1831
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,990
and listen to to Put in for four hours
every December. An incredible

1832
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,000
every December. An incredible
 

1833
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,670
every December. An incredible
performance on the president's part and

1834
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
performance on the president's part and
 

1835
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,510
performance on the president's part and
an incredible performance on the Russian

1836
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:01,520
an incredible performance on the Russian
 

1837
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,990
an incredible performance on the Russian
people's part. But Trump doesn't have

1838
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
people's part. But Trump doesn't have
 

1839
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,950
people's part. But Trump doesn't have
five minutes of patience to listen. So

1840
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:06,960
five minutes of patience to listen. So
 

1841
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,470
five minutes of patience to listen. So
Vance's really important job is to

1842
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:10,480
Vance's really important job is to
 

1843
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,750
Vance's really important job is to
mobilize the British

1844
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
mobilize the British
 

1845
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,349
mobilize the British
to lead the way in Europe for getting

1846
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:17,359

1847
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,109
to lead the way in Europe for getting
Zalinski

1848
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:19,119

Zalinski
on board for the implementation of a

1850
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:23,119
on board for the implementation of a
 

1851
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,670
on board for the implementation of a
ceasefire that lets the US get out of

1852
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:25,680
ceasefire that lets the US get out of
 

1853
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,430
ceasefire that lets the US get out of
the war

1854
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:27,440
the war
 

1855
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,190
the war
and brings the curtain down from a Trump

1856
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,200
and brings the curtain down from a Trump
 

1857
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,270
and brings the curtain down from a Trump
point of view.

1858
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:33,280
point of view.
 

1859
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,710
point of view.
Right? And that's an exchange of signals

1860
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
Right? And that's an exchange of signals
 

1861
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,349
Right? And that's an exchange of signals
of trust

1862
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:39,359
of trust
 

1863
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,030
of trust
which have yet to be proved. But this is

1864
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,040
which have yet to be proved. But this is
 

1865
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,150
which have yet to be proved. But this is
how we started. That's this is why

1866
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,160
how we started. That's this is why
 

1867
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,190
how we started. That's this is why
the Russian sources I've talked to to

1868
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:51,200
the Russian sources I've talked to to
 

1869
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,750
the Russian sources I've talked to to
through the night believe that this was

00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
through the night believe that this was
 

1871
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,069
through the night believe that this was
a significant success for Putin

1872
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:58,079
a significant success for Putin

success for Trump
 

1877
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,510
success for Trump
which they're not publishing

1878
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:07,520
which they're not publishing
 

1879
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,470
which they're not publishing
because the you look at the Western

But there's obviously

But there's obviously

after this years of distrust of the
Americans advancing to destroy Russia,

1892
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:32,079
Americans advancing to destroy Russia,
 

1893
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,390
Americans advancing to destroy Russia,
this is the best bet the Russians have

1894
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,400
this is the best bet the Russians have
 

1895
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,710
this is the best bet the Russians have
got to stop that on one battlefield

1896
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:38,720
got to stop that on one battlefield
 

1897
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,750
got to stop that on one battlefield
without illusions about all the others.

1898
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,760
without illusions about all the others.
 

1899
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,589
without illusions about all the others.
Right. So just uh to uh very important

1900
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:45,599
Right. So just uh to uh very important
 

1901
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,510
Right. So just uh to uh very important
point you made about uh the Hannity

1902
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
point you made about uh the Hannity
 

1903
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,270
point you made about uh the Hannity
interview. I just want to tell our

1904
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,280
interview. I just want to tell our
 

1905
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,030
interview. I just want to tell our
audience exactly what was said. Uh Trump

1906
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,040
audience exactly what was said. Uh Trump
 

1907
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,030
audience exactly what was said. Uh Trump
told Fox News Hannity that he would hold

1908
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
told Fox News Hannity that he would hold
 

1909
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,430
told Fox News Hannity that he would hold
off on imposing tariffs on China for

1910
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
off on imposing tariffs on China for
 

1911
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,430
off on imposing tariffs on China for
buying Russian oil after making progress

1912
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
buying Russian oil after making progress
 

1913
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,390
buying Russian oil after making progress
with Putin. He apparently Trump did not

1914
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:02,400
with Putin. He apparently Trump did not
 

1915
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,710
with Putin. He apparently Trump did not
mention India, another major buyer of

1916
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
mention India, another major buyer of
 

1917
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,150
mention India, another major buyer of
Russian crude which has been slapped

1918
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:06,160
Russian crude which has been slapped
 

1919
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,990
Russian crude which has been slapped
with a total of 50% tariff on US

1920
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,000
with a total of 50% tariff on US
 

1921
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,670
with a total of 50% tariff on US
imports. Um, and the quote is from that

1922
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:11,680
imports. Um, and the quote is from that
 

1923
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,870
imports. Um, and the quote is from that
interview, because of what happened

1924
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:12,880
interview, because of what happened
 

1925
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,710
interview, because of what happened
today, I think I don't have to think

1926
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:14,720
today, I think I don't have to think
 

1927
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,510
today, I think I don't have to think
about that now. Uh, referring to Chinese

1928
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
about that now. Uh, referring to Chinese
 

1929
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,990
about that now. Uh, referring to Chinese
tariffs. And he goes on and says, Trump,

1930
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,000
tariffs. And he goes on and says, Trump,
 

1931
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,670
tariffs. And he goes on and says, Trump,
I may have to think about it in two

1932
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:21,680
I may have to think about it in two
 

1933
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,349
I may have to think about it in two
weeks or 3 weeks or something, but we

1934
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
weeks or 3 weeks or something, but we
 

1935
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,630
weeks or 3 weeks or something, but we
don't have to think about that right

1936
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:24,640
don't have to think about that right
 

1937
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,270
don't have to think about that right
now. And of course, the deadline for

1938
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,280
now. And of course, the deadline for
 

1939
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,510
now. And of course, the deadline for
imposing those tariffs, those secondary

1940
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
imposing those tariffs, those secondary
 

1941
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,030
imposing those tariffs, those secondary
sanctions has passed.

1942
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:31,040
sanctions has passed.
 

1943
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,069
sanctions has passed.
Uh, yes.

1944
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:32,079
Uh, yes.
 

1945
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,109
Uh, yes.
Question about it. Now, um, just another

1946
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:35,119
Question about it. Now, um, just another
 

1947
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,870
Question about it. Now, um, just another
observation. I don't think you need to

1948
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
observation. I don't think you need to
 

1949
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,150
observation. I don't think you need to
comment on this, so if you would like

1950
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
comment on this, so if you would like
 

1951
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,870
comment on this, so if you would like
to, please do so. I imagine, it's

1952
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880
to, please do so. I imagine, it's
 

1953
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,470
to, please do so. I imagine, it's
interesting that he took Rubio into this

1954
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:42,480
interesting that he took Rubio into this
 

1955
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,470
interesting that he took Rubio into this
meeting. Uh, because I imagine that

1956
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:44,480
meeting. Uh, because I imagine that
 

1957
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,230
meeting. Uh, because I imagine that
Rubio, first of all, we all know Rubio

1958
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:46,240
Rubio, first of all, we all know Rubio
 

1959
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,950
Rubio, first of all, we all know Rubio
to be a frauding at the mouth neoon. Uh,

1960
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:48,960
to be a frauding at the mouth neoon. Uh,
 

1961
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,349
to be a frauding at the mouth neoon. Uh,
and probably somebody in that uh, you

1962
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359
and probably somebody in that uh, you
 

1963
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,349
and probably somebody in that uh, you
know, cabinet who uh, doesn't want to

1964
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:53,359
know, cabinet who uh, doesn't want to
 

1965
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,750
know, cabinet who uh, doesn't want to
see uh, the United States withdraw. I

1966
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
see uh, the United States withdraw. I
 

1967
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,670
see uh, the United States withdraw. I
don't I'm not convinced that Rubio

1968
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:57,680
don't I'm not convinced that Rubio
 

1969
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,069
don't I'm not convinced that Rubio
actually wants that. But in any event,

1970
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:00,079
actually wants that. But in any event,
 

1971
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,750
actually wants that. But in any event,
um I imagine this is probably the first

1972
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:01,760
um I imagine this is probably the first
 

1973
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,990
um I imagine this is probably the first
time that Rubio has actually met

1974
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,000
time that Rubio has actually met
 

1975
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,589
time that Rubio has actually met
Vladimir Putin. Uh I I I can't imag I

1976
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:07,599
Vladimir Putin. Uh I I I can't imag I
 

1977
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,829
Vladimir Putin. Uh I I I can't imag I
can't think of a circumstance in the

1978
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:09,839
can't think of a circumstance in the
 

1979
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,750
can't think of a circumstance in the
past where Rubio would have had an

1980
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:11,760
past where Rubio would have had an
 

1981
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,950
past where Rubio would have had an
opportunity to sit down and talk to

1982
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,960
opportunity to sit down and talk to
 

1983
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,349
opportunity to sit down and talk to
Putin one-on-one. So um perhaps uh

1984
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:17,359
Putin one-on-one. So um perhaps uh
 

1985
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,950
Putin one-on-one. So um perhaps uh
perhaps this has had some positive

1986
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
perhaps this has had some positive
 

1987
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,190
perhaps this has had some positive
impact on Rubio's view of this conflict,

1988
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,200
impact on Rubio's view of this conflict,
 

1989
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,950
impact on Rubio's view of this conflict,
but that remains to be seen. What I

1990
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960
but that remains to be seen. What I
 

1991
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,190
but that remains to be seen. What I
really want to talk about next, John, um

1992
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,200
really want to talk about next, John, um
 

1993
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,710
really want to talk about next, John, um
is this uh commentary from Trump in the

1994
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:28,720
is this uh commentary from Trump in the
 

1995
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,870
is this uh commentary from Trump in the
in the few minutes that he spoke at the

1996
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:30,880
in the few minutes that he spoke at the
 

1997
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,069
in the few minutes that he spoke at the
press conference uh with Vladimir Putin.

1998
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:34,079
press conference uh with Vladimir Putin.
 

1999
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,670
press conference uh with Vladimir Putin.
I believe we had a very productive

2000
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:35,680
I believe we had a very productive
 

2001
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,109
I believe we had a very productive
meeting. There were many many points

2002
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:37,119
meeting. There were many many points
 

2003
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,150
meeting. There were many many points
that we agreed on, most of them, I would

2004
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:40,160
that we agreed on, most of them, I would
 

2005
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,270
that we agreed on, most of them, I would
say, a couple of big ones that we

2006
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,280
say, a couple of big ones that we
 

2007
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,950
say, a couple of big ones that we
haven't quite gotten there, but we've

2008
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:44,960
haven't quite gotten there, but we've
 

2009
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,030
haven't quite gotten there, but we've
made some headway.

2010
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040
made some headway.
 

2011
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,349
made some headway.
So, uh there's no deal until there's a

2012
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:49,359
So, uh there's no deal until there's a
 

2013
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,630
So, uh there's no deal until there's a
deal. I will call up NATO in a little

2014
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:52,640
deal. I will call up NATO in a little
 

2015
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,150
deal. I will call up NATO in a little
while. I will call up uh the various

They're going to have to agree with what
 

2027
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,750
They're going to have to agree with what
Marco and Steve and some of the great

Marco and Steve and some of the great
 

2029
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,829
Marco and Steve and some of the great
people from the Trump administration.

2030
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:11,839
people from the Trump administration.
 

2031
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:15,829
people from the Trump administration.
Now, uh you you heard him say, John, uh

Now, uh you you heard him say, John, uh

00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
that it's ultimately up to them.
 

2035
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,990
that it's ultimately up to them.
Exactly.

2036
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:20,000
Exactly.
 

2037
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,670
Exactly.
I I just find that comical. I'm sorry to

2038
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
I I just find that comical. I'm sorry to

It's certainly not the first time I've

2042
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:27,760
It's certainly not the first time I've
 

2043
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,750
It's certainly not the first time I've
been disrespectful of Trump, nor will it

2044
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:29,760
been disrespectful of Trump, nor will it
 

2045
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,990
been disrespectful of Trump, nor will it
be the last, but I find that comical. I

2046
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,000
be the last, but I find that comical. I
 

2047
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,069
be the last, but I find that comical. I
mean, as Trump himself said in the White

2048
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:34,079
mean, as Trump himself said in the White
 

2049
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,990
mean, as Trump himself said in the White
House a few months ago, you ain't got no

2050
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,000
House a few months ago, you ain't got no
 

2051
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,190
House a few months ago, you ain't got no
cards, uh, Vimir Zilinski. Um, and you

2052
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,200
cards, uh, Vimir Zilinski. Um, and you
 

2053
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,109
cards, uh, Vimir Zilinski. Um, and you
know, his government is completely and

2054
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:41,119
know, his government is completely and
 

2055
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,150
know, his government is completely and
utterly dependent upon, uh, you know,

2056
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,160
utterly dependent upon, uh, you know,
 

2057
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,069
utterly dependent upon, uh, you know,
American military intelligence and

00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:46,079
American military intelligence and
 

2059
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,630
American military intelligence and
economic aid. Uh so uh it sounds like

2060
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
economic aid. Uh so uh it sounds like
 

2061
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,670
economic aid. Uh so uh it sounds like
he's basically at least claiming to be

2062
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:53,680
he's basically at least claiming to be
 

2063
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,670
he's basically at least claiming to be
conferring upon Zilinsky a veto power

2064
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:55,680
conferring upon Zilinsky a veto power
 

2065
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,750
conferring upon Zilinsky a veto power
over whatever deal was struck with the

2066
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:57,760
over whatever deal was struck with the
 

2067
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,630
over whatever deal was struck with the
Russian Federation. Uh so what do you

00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:00,640
Russian Federation. Uh so what do you
 

2069
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,230
Russian Federation. Uh so what do you
make of this comment? First of all, is

00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,240
make of this comment? First of all, is
 

2071
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,710
make of this comment? First of all, is
he just, you know, trying to is Trump

2072
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:04,720
he just, you know, trying to is Trump
 

2073
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,190
he just, you know, trying to is Trump
simply trying to perpetuate the myth

2074
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:07,200
simply trying to perpetuate the myth
 

2075
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,829
simply trying to perpetuate the myth
that Ukraine remains a sovereign state

2076
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:09,839
that Ukraine remains a sovereign state
 

2077
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,150
that Ukraine remains a sovereign state
or is he really

00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,160
or is he really
 

2079
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,069
or is he really

best way to view Zilinsky visa v Trump a

00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:20,880
best way to view Zilinsky visa v Trump a
 

2085
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,710
best way to view Zilinsky visa v Trump a
veto power over whatever deal he has

2086
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
veto power over whatever deal he has

2093
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,990
effectively Zalinsky can veto this today
if he can tank the deal, why would

2094
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
if he can tank the deal, why would
 

2095
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,589
if he can tank the deal, why would
anybody think that he isn't going to do

2096
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:35,599
anybody think that he isn't going to do
 

2097
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,270
anybody think that he isn't going to do
that? I mean, didn't they just issue a

you know, fantastically ludicrous demand
 

2105
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,030
you know, fantastically ludicrous demand
that Russia pay reparations and withdraw

2106
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,040
that Russia pay reparations and withdraw
 

2107
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,190
that Russia pay reparations and withdraw
from all of the territory and Ukraine

2108
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,200
from all of the territory and Ukraine
 

2109
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,630
from all of the territory and Ukraine
will be a part of NATO and uh and who

Bob's your uncle. I mean, every

2114
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:57,520
Bob's your uncle. I mean, every
 

2115
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,069
Bob's your uncle. I mean, every
imaginable demand that Ukraine could.

2116
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
imaginable demand that Ukraine could.
 

2117
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,670
imaginable demand that Ukraine could.
Oh, and no lifting of sanctions on

2118
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
Oh, and no lifting of sanctions on
 

2119
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,670
Oh, and no lifting of sanctions on
Russia. That was the position. And

2120
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:03,680
Russia. That was the position. And
 

2121
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,990
Russia. That was the position. And
Zalinsky has consistently been

2122
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:06,000
Zalinsky has consistently been
 

2123
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,309
Zalinsky has consistently been
maximalist. So, it just seems to me that

2124
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:08,319
maximalist. So, it just seems to me that
 

2125
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,470
maximalist. So, it just seems to me that
if he in fact does have the ability, if

2126
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:10,480
if he in fact does have the ability, if

if he in fact does have the ability, if
he's being given the authority by the

00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:12,240
he's being given the authority by the
 

2129
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,150
he's being given the authority by the
Trump administration to tank the deal,

2130
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,160
Trump administration to tank the deal,
 

2131
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,630
Trump administration to tank the deal,
it's a virtual certainty that he will.

2132
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
it's a virtual certainty that he will.
 

2133
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,030
it's a virtual certainty that he will.

00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:58,160
Trump lost Putin won. Well, no, it's not
 

2353
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,750
Trump lost Putin won. Well, no, it's not
quite that from a Russian point of view,

2354
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:01,760
quite that from a Russian point of view,
 

2355
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,030
quite that from a Russian point of view,
Putin won. But I hope it's clear from a

2356
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
Putin won. But I hope it's clear from a
 

2357
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,349
Putin won. But I hope it's clear from a
limited conditional point of view, this

2358
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,359
limited conditional point of view, this
 

2359
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,589
limited conditional point of view, this
is what had to be understood by the

2360
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:09,599
is what had to be understood by the
 

2361
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,190
is what had to be understood by the
president of Russia and he had to buy it

2362
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,200
president of Russia and he had to buy it
 

2363
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,390
president of Russia and he had to buy it
by making the kinds of concessions that

2364
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:16,400
by making the kinds of concessions that
 

2365
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,069
by making the kinds of concessions that
allowed put Trump to grandstand but that

2366
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:20,079
allowed put Trump to grandstand but that
 

2367
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,150
allowed put Trump to grandstand but that
in principle this summit could have

2368
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,160
in principle this summit could have
 

2369
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,630
in principle this summit could have
happened months ago.

2370
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:24,640
happened months ago.
 

2371
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,470
happened months ago.
Right? I mean, the ludicrous thing about

2372
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:26,480
Right? I mean, the ludicrous thing about
 

2373
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,390
Right? I mean, the ludicrous thing about
them saying Trump lost is that the war

2374
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:28,400
them saying Trump lost is that the war
 

2375
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,270
them saying Trump lost is that the war
has already lost and it was really lost

2376
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:31,280
has already lost and it was really lost
 

2377
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,829
has already lost and it was really lost
even before Trump the White House. So,

2378
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839
even before Trump the White House. So,
 

2379
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,109
even before Trump the White House. So,
it's just a question of how are you

2380
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:35,119
it's just a question of how are you
 

2381
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,790
it's just a question of how are you
going to clean up this mess. It's not a

2382
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:36,800
going to clean up this mess. It's not a
 

2383
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,150
going to clean up this mess. It's not a
question of who's won and who's lost.

2384
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:38,160
question of who's won and who's lost.
 

2385
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,230
question of who's won and who's lost.
That's already been resolved. Which

2386
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
That's already been resolved. Which
 

2387
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,589
That's already been resolved. Which
brings me to my next question. Uh, you

2388
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
brings me to my next question. Uh, you
 

2389
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,270
brings me to my next question. Uh, you
know, we haven't talked about the state

understanding of the current state of

understanding of the current state of
the battlefield. So this brings me to my

2556
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:06,880
the battlefield. So this brings me to my
 

2557
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,630
the battlefield. So this brings me to my
last question. In light of this rapidly

2558
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:08,640
last question. In light of this rapidly
 

2559
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,670
last question. In light of this rapidly
deteriorating situation, John, for the

Ukrainian forces, I I don't mean to
 

2563
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,349
Ukrainian forces, I I don't mean to
laugh. It's actually tragic what has

2564
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:15,359
laugh. It's actually tragic what has
 

2565

happened to the country. But what I

what's causing me to chuckle is the

2568
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:19,920
what's causing me to chuckle is the
 

2569
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,069
what's causing me to chuckle is the
disparity between what you've just

2570
01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:22,079
disparity between what you've just
 

2571
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,750
disparity between what you've just
described, which I think is an entirely

01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:23,760
described, which I think is an entirely
 

2573
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,069
described, which I think is an entirely
fair assessment, and the maximalist

2574
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:26,079
fair assessment, and the maximalist
 

2575
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:29,349
fair assessment, and the maximalist
position of the Zilinski regime backed

2579
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,030
apparently by all major European
governments. It seems that that is also

01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:33,040
governments. It seems that that is also
 

2581
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,430
governments. It seems that that is also
their position. How perhaps here I'm

2582
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,440
their position. How perhaps here I'm
 

2583

their position. How perhaps here I'm
asking you to psychoanalyze but how do

this past week. And he lost in court. He
 

2823
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,910
this past week. And he lost in court. He
can't replace the the the police chief

2824
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:47,920
can't replace the the the police chief
 

2825
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,390
can't replace the the the police chief
of the district in which he's the

2826
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:50,400
of the district in which he's the
 

2827
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,390
of the district in which he's the
principal resident. Well, well, well.

2828
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:54,400
principal resident. Well, well, well.
 

2829
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,150

Right. For what it's worth, John, you

2830
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
Right. For what it's worth, John, you
 

2831
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,589
Right. For what it's worth, John, you
know, my own uh best guess as to why the

2832
01:06:59,589 --> 01:06:59,599
know, my own uh best guess as to why the
 

2833
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,150
know, my own uh best guess as to why the
Europeans and Zilinsky remain maximalist

2834
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,160
Europeans and Zilinsky remain maximalist
 

2835
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,029
Europeans and Zilinsky remain maximalist
is that they are so politically invested

2836
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:05,039
is that they are so politically invested
 

2837
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,230
is that they are so politically invested
in victory that if they were to exceed

2838
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:08,240
in victory that if they were to exceed
 

2839
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,150
in victory that if they were to exceed
to Russia's terms, even half of what

2840
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,160
to Russia's terms, even half of what
 

2841
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,549
to Russia's terms, even half of what
Russia is demanding, they understand

2842
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:12,559
Russia is demanding, they understand
 

2843
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,549
Russia is demanding, they understand
that they'd be turfed out of office in

2844
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:14,559
that they'd be turfed out of office in
 

2845
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,630
that they'd be turfed out of office in
the blink of an eye. uh if the and not

2846
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,640
the blink of an eye. uh if the and not
 

2847
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,870
the blink of an eye. uh if the and not
because the European people are

2848
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:18,880
because the European people are
 

2849
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,670
because the European people are
determined to press on to victory. It's

2850
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:21,680
determined to press on to victory. It's
 

2851
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,109
determined to press on to victory. It's
because a lot of Europeans will say you

2852
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:25,119
because a lot of Europeans will say you
 

2853
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,029
because a lot of Europeans will say you
sold us a fake bill of goods. You've

2854
01:07:27,029 --> 01:07:27,039
sold us a fake bill of goods. You've
 

2855
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,670
sold us a fake bill of goods. You've
been telling us since February 2022 that

2856
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,680
been telling us since February 2022 that
 

2857
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,190
been telling us since February 2022 that
Ukraine was going to win this war.

2858
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:31,200
Ukraine was going to win this war.
 

2859
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,270
Ukraine was going to win this war.
You've caused us to invest massive

2860
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,280
You've caused us to invest massive
 

2861
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,069
You've caused us to invest massive
amounts of money in this war. You have

2862
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:36,079
amounts of money in this war. You have
 

2863
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,150
amounts of money in this war. You have
uh fueled a conflict which you could

2864
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:38,160
uh fueled a conflict which you could
 

2865
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,910
uh fueled a conflict which you could
have resolved long ago that has killed

2866
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:39,920
have resolved long ago that has killed
 

2867
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,510
have resolved long ago that has killed
hundreds of thousands, millions of

2868
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:41,520
hundreds of thousands, millions of
 

2869
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,990
hundreds of thousands, millions of
people probably at this stage. You're a

2870
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,000
people probably at this stage. You're a
 

2871
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,589
people probably at this stage. You're a
bunch of liars. you're corrupt

2872
01:07:45,589 --> 01:07:45,599
bunch of liars. you're corrupt
 

2873
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,349
bunch of liars. you're corrupt
wararmongers and we're we're fed up with

2874
01:07:47,349 --> 01:07:47,359
wararmongers and we're we're fed up with
 

2875
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,349
wararmongers and we're we're fed up with
you. And I think that that's ultimately

2876
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:49,359
you. And I think that that's ultimately
 

2877
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,109
you. And I think that that's ultimately
what is going on here. That's my best

2878
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:51,119
what is going on here. That's my best
 

2879
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:52,630
what is going on here. That's my best
guess at any rate. I can't read their

2880
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:52,640
guess at any rate. I can't read their
 

2881
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,029
guess at any rate. I can't read their
minds, but it seems to me that they are

2882
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:55,039
minds, but it seems to me that they are
 

2883
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,510
minds, but it seems to me that they are
uh desperately trying to uh uh pro uh to

2884
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520
uh desperately trying to uh uh pro uh to
 

2885
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,230
uh desperately trying to uh uh pro uh to
defer judgment day for as long as

2886
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:02,240
defer judgment day for as long as
 

2887
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,630
defer judgment day for as long as
possible. uh preferably at a point where

2888
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:04,640
possible. uh preferably at a point where
 

2889
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,589
possible. uh preferably at a point where
they're no longer uh young enough to do

2890
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:07,599
they're no longer uh young enough to do
 

2891
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,190
they're no longer uh young enough to do
politics, so they're retired from

2892
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:11,200
politics, so they're retired from
 

2893
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,710
politics, so they're retired from
Well, there's certainly that, but

2894
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:12,720
Well, there's certainly that, but
 

2895
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,029
Well, there's certainly that, but
they're playing constituency politics.

2896
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:15,039
they're playing constituency politics.
 

2897
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:17,829
they're playing constituency politics.
They want to, yes, they may be losing on

2898
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:17,839
They want to, yes, they may be losing on
 

2899
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:19,189
They want to, yes, they may be losing on
that battlefield, but they want to

2900
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:19,199
that battlefield, but they want to
 

2901
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:20,789
that battlefield, but they want to
preserve the arms builders as

2902
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:20,799
preserve the arms builders as
 

2903
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:23,749
preserve the arms builders as
constituents. They want to keep building

2904
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:23,759
constituents. They want to keep building
 

2905
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,070
constituents. They want to keep building
um uh and financing a war against an

votes in those regions or all of those
 

2911
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,630
votes in those regions or all of those
things and if we und if we took each

2912
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:36,640
things and if we und if we took each
 

2913
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,550
things and if we und if we took each
country Italy, France, Portugal, Spain,

01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
country Italy, France, Portugal, Spain,

uh the UK, uh the Netherlands one by
 

2917
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,709
uh the UK, uh the Netherlands one by
one, the the constituencies would be

2918
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:46,719
one, the the constituencies would be
 

2919
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,510
one, the the constituencies would be
different. But yes, they can't suddenly

2920
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,520
different. But yes, they can't suddenly
 

2921
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,630
different. But yes, they can't suddenly
say we see the light. Why? Because their

2922
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
say we see the light. Why? Because their
 

2923
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,749
say we see the light. Why? Because their
propaganda war has been won. There isn't

2924
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:55,759
propaganda war has been won. There isn't
 

2925
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,789
propaganda war has been won. There isn't
a single significant

01:08:58,789 --> 01:08:58,799
a single significant

01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,390
a single significant
um mainstream press in in any of the

um mainstream press in in any of the
 

2929
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,550
um mainstream press in in any of the
European states that I can think of

2930
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:04,560
European states that I can think of
 

2931
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,870
European states that I can think of
that's anti-war. There's no anti-war

2932
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:06,880
that's anti-war. There's no anti-war
 

2933
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,630
that's anti-war. There's no anti-war
movement in the United States of of a

2934
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
movement in the United States of of a
 

2935
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,870
movement in the United States of of a
significant power the way there was

2936
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:12,880
significant power the way there was
 

2937
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,229
significant power the way there was
during the Vietnam War. So um

2938
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:18,239
during the Vietnam War. So um
 

2939
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:21,189
during the Vietnam War. So um
the the uh they've got to somehow

2940
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:21,199
the the uh they've got to somehow
 

2941
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:24,070
the the uh they've got to somehow
preserve differently from one country to

2942
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:24,080
preserve differently from one country to
 

2943
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,590
preserve differently from one country to
another one political setup from another

another one political setup from another
 

2945
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,950
another one political setup from another
um avoiding the blame for losing

um avoiding the blame for losing
 

2947
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,430
um avoiding the blame for losing
um and somehow u cope with the

01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:35,440
um and somehow u cope with the
 

2949
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,829
um and somehow u cope with the
propaganda defeat. It can't be a defeat

2950
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
propaganda defeat. It can't be a defeat
 

2951
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,550
propaganda defeat. It can't be a defeat
because they keep saying

2952
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:40,560
because they keep saying
 

2953
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,709
because they keep saying
that that they've won.

2954
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:42,719
that that they've won.
 

2955

That's right. I I'm I mean you and I and

our audience are in the unique position
of not believing any of that stuff and

of not believing any of that stuff and
 

2961
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,749
of not believing any of that stuff and
finding it impossible to believe that

finding it impossible to believe that
 

2963
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,229
finding it impossible to believe that
people go on believing it. But the fact

2964
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:56,239
people go on believing it. But the fact
 

2965
01:09:56,239 --> 01:10:00,149
people go on believing it. But the fact
is we're the minority.

2966
01:10:00,149 --> 01:10:00,159
is we're the minority.
 

2967

politically powerful in each of these
 

2977
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:19,990
politically powerful in each of these

2978
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:20,000

note, uh I was reading the Guardians
 

2983
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,790
note, uh I was reading the Guardians
coverage this morning. It pains me to

2984
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:26,800
coverage this morning. It pains me to
 

2985
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,750
coverage this morning. It pains me to
have to read that newspaper, but I force

2986
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:29,760
have to read that newspaper, but I force
 

2987
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,070
have to read that newspaper, but I force
myself to do so because it's kind of

2988
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:32,080
myself to do so because it's kind of
 

2989
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,390
myself to do so because it's kind of
representative of the so-called liberal

2990
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:34,400
representative of the so-called liberal
 

2991
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,350
representative of the so-called liberal
wing of the mainstream press in uh in

2992
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:37,360
wing of the mainstream press in uh in
 

2993
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,910
wing of the mainstream press in uh in
the English- speakaking world. And uh it

2994
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:39,920
the English- speakaking world. And uh it
 

2995
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,310
the English- speakaking world. And uh it
was just implacably hostile. The tenor

2996
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:42,320
was just implacably hostile. The tenor
 

2997
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,390
was just implacably hostile. The tenor
of the coverage was implacably hostile

2998
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,400
of the coverage was implacably hostile
 

2999
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,510

to any peace deal between uh Russia and

to any peace deal between uh Russia and
 

3001
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,310
to any peace deal between uh Russia and
the United States. Uh and that's

3002
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:50,320
the United States. Uh and that's
 

3003
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,390
the United States. Uh and that's
supposed to be the progressive end of

3004
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
supposed to be the progressive end of
 

3005
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,950
supposed to be the progressive end of
the political spectrum in the West. So,
