## Key Points & Red Flags of AI Writing 🚩🤖

### 1. Overuse of the M-Dash (—) 📏
- AI ❤️ uses the M-dash *way* more than humans.
- Many don’t know how to type it, so when it appears frequently, it’s suspicious.
- Example: Used like punctuation to separate sentences (more than a semicolon).
- Evan explains how even he uses it, but AI *overuses* it!

### 2. Parallel Sentence Structures 🔁
- Phrases like **"It’s not just X, it’s Y."** appear often in AI writing.
- Common in LinkedIn posts 📄 and generic text.
- This structure is a *tell* of AI-generated content.

### 3. The Rule of Three ▪️▪️▪️
- AI often lists things in groups of three for a “complete feel.”
- Humans use 3 or 5 points to make info memorable; AI leans on this too predictably.
- Examples include lists of three benefits or key points.

### 4. Generic & Vague Language 🤷‍♂️
- AI loves safe, vague adjectives like *innovative, practical, elevate, delve*.
- Text can feel like it *says a lot but means nothing*.
- Politicians’ speeches or bland corporate emails often show this.

### 5. Awkward Tone & Uncanny Valley of Language 😬
- Writing feels "off" or unnatural.
- Strange phrasing that doesn’t quite fit the context.
- Filler words or overly polite/formal style that doesn’t feel human.

### 6. Exaggerated and Insincere Praise 🙌
- AI tends to overpraise in a bland and repetitive way.
- Like *"Your work is genuinely captivating and inspiring."* but feels hollow.

### 7. Awkward Weird Analogies & Similes 🎭
- Analogies that try too hard but fall flat.
- Example given: "like a band-aid made of sandpaper".
- Feels forced, unlike natural human storytelling.

### 8. Repetition & Over Clarification 🔄
- AI repeats points unnecessarily.
- Provides extra context or filler that wastes time.
- Example: Explains simple things with over-the-top detail.

### 9. Format & Emojis in Lists 📋😊
- AI loves bullet lists, often with emojis at the start of each point.
- This style became popular before AI, but combined with generic content is a clue.

### 10. Lack of Personal Touch & Stories 🗣️❤️
- Human writing often includes personal anecdotes, first-person experiences, and emotions.
- AI writing is generic and impersonal.
- Tangents and personal comments are strong signs of human authorship.

## How to Spot Human Writing 🧑‍💻📝
- Contains personal stories and opinions.
- Writes with personality, quirks, and sometimes imperfect grammar ✍️.
- Includes tangents relevant to the topic but adding depth.
- Shows genuine emotion and context beyond surface-level praise.

## Evan’s Example: Real vs AI Comment 💬

- **AI Comment:** Overly formal, bland praise, no personal touch, uses generic compliments 🥱.
- **Human Comment:** Adds personal context (*“As a northerner...”*), honest opinion, natural language 🥳.

Evan even humorously caught a friend who replaced M-dashes with hyphens to disguise AI writing! 😆

## Final Thoughts & Fun Challenge 🔍🎉
- Trust your gut! If it "feels off," it probably is 🤔.
- AI doesn’t have "guts" or authentic vibes yet.

- You can get better at detecting AI with practice! 💪
