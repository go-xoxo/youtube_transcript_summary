to add five Republican seats. Other
 

159
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,710
to add five Republican seats. Other
Republican states have already done it.

160
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
Republican states have already done it.
 

161
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,390
Republican states have already done it.
The map overall is already gerrymandered

162
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
The map overall is already gerrymandered
 

163
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,350
The map overall is already gerrymandered
by Republicans. Democrats in the House

164
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
by Republicans. Democrats in the House
 

165
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,229
by Republicans. Democrats in the House
to get 50% of the seats, depending on

166
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
to get 50% of the seats, depending on
 

167
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,350
to get 50% of the seats, depending on
the analysis, need 54% of the vote.

168
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
the analysis, need 54% of the vote.
 

169
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,990
the analysis, need 54% of the vote.
That's gerrymandered for Republicans.

170
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
That's gerrymandered for Republicans.
 

171
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,309
That's gerrymandered for Republicans.
I'm against gerrymandering, but I'm not

172
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
I'm against gerrymandering, but I'm not
 

173
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,550
I'm against gerrymandering, but I'm not
going to unilaterally disarm. We're

174
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
going to unilaterally disarm. We're
 

175
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,229
going to unilaterally disarm. We're
going to fight fire with fire. And

176
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
going to fight fire with fire. And
 

177
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,630
going to fight fire with fire. And
remember, this is up for a referendum in

178
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
remember, this is up for a referendum in
 

179
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,190
remember, this is up for a referendum in
California. If California residents

180
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
California. If California residents
 

181
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,470
California. If California residents
don't want it, they won't get it. So, we

182
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
don't want it, they won't get it. So, we
 

183
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,710
don't want it, they won't get it. So, we
shouldn't sit back and say, "We're going

184
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
shouldn't sit back and say, "We're going
 

185
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,550
shouldn't sit back and say, "We're going
to be better people." They can

186
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
to be better people." They can
 

187
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,830
to be better people." They can
gerrymander to high heaven and keep the

188
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
gerrymander to high heaven and keep the
 

189
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,390
gerrymander to high heaven and keep the
house and win the house, but we're not

190
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
house and win the house, but we're not
 

191
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,670
house and win the house, but we're not
going to do anything. We're just going

192
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
going to do anything. We're just going
 

193
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,670
going to do anything. We're just going
to sit aside. And Gavin Newsome is

194
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
to sit aside. And Gavin Newsome is
 

195
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,110
to sit aside. And Gavin Newsome is
saying, "Not this time." Now, you don't

196
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
saying, "Not this time." Now, you don't
 

197
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,030
saying, "Not this time." Now, you don't
have to like Gavin Newsome. You might

198
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
have to like Gavin Newsome. You might
 

199
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,030
have to like Gavin Newsome. You might
say, "Gavin Newsome is too far to the

200
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
say, "Gavin Newsome is too far to the
 

201
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,270
say, "Gavin Newsome is too far to the
right, or he's too far to the left."

202
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
right, or he's too far to the left."
 

203
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,030
right, or he's too far to the left."
There's people that say both. Or he's

204
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
There's people that say both. Or he's
 

205
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,429
There's people that say both. Or he's
too slick for his own good, or I don't

206
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
too slick for his own good, or I don't
 

207
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,870
too slick for his own good, or I don't
like that hairstyle, or whatever. But

208
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
like that hairstyle, or whatever. But
 

209
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,310
like that hairstyle, or whatever. But
he's fighting. And unfortunately, I hate

210
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
he's fighting. And unfortunately, I hate
 

211
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,550
he's fighting. And unfortunately, I hate
to admit it, that is more than can be

212
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
to admit it, that is more than can be
 

213
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,870
to admit it, that is more than can be
said for a lot of Democrats right now.

214
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
said for a lot of Democrats right now.
 

215
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,030
said for a lot of Democrats right now.
So, California's le leg legislature is

216
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
So, California's le leg legislature is
 

217
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,830
So, California's le leg legislature is
going to prepare the maps. Nuome has

218
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
going to prepare the maps. Nuome has
 

219
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,830
going to prepare the maps. Nuome has
even uh um uh floated the idea

220
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
even uh um uh floated the idea
 

221
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,430
even uh um uh floated the idea
um that well actually I'm not even going

222
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
um that well actually I'm not even going
 

223
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,790
um that well actually I'm not even going
to get that, but I'm going to talk about

224
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
to get that, but I'm going to talk about
 

225
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,469
to get that, but I'm going to talk about
what could happen in other states in a

226
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
what could happen in other states in a
 

227
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,710
what could happen in other states in a
moment. But the point here is this is

228
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
moment. But the point here is this is
 

229
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,909
moment. But the point here is this is
not a vague process. Republicans are

230
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
not a vague process. Republicans are
 

231
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,670
not a vague process. Republicans are
already screaming about fairness, which

232
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
already screaming about fairness, which
 

233
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,749
already screaming about fairness, which
is rich coming from the people who

234
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
is rich coming from the people who
 

235
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,629
is rich coming from the people who
perfected the concept of unfair maps,

236
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
perfected the concept of unfair maps,
 

237
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,270
perfected the concept of unfair maps,
racially biased maps, politically biased

238
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
racially biased maps, politically biased
 

239
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,550
racially biased maps, politically biased
maps. But the bottom line is this.

240
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
maps. But the bottom line is this.
 

241
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,749
maps. But the bottom line is this.
If Democrats retake the House in 2026,

242
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
If Democrats retake the House in 2026,
 

243
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,749
If Democrats retake the House in 2026,
Donald Trump's supposed unstoppable

244
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
Donald Trump's supposed unstoppable
 

245
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,510
Donald Trump's supposed unstoppable
presidency, his mandate, his

246
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
presidency, his mandate, his
 

247
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,830
presidency, his mandate, his
unrestrainable agenda is dead. And now

248
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
unrestrainable agenda is dead. And now
 

249
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,150
unrestrainable agenda is dead. And now
many of you will say, "Isn't this a race

250
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
many of you will say, "Isn't this a race
 

251
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,950
many of you will say, "Isn't this a race
to the bottom?" If Cal if California

252
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
to the bottom?" If Cal if California
 

253
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,950
to the bottom?" If Cal if California
does it because Texas is doing it and

254
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
does it because Texas is doing it and
 

255
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,189
does it because Texas is doing it and
then that's right, but they've already

256
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
then that's right, but they've already
 

257
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,590
then that's right, but they've already
done it. Since they've already done it,

258
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
done it. Since they've already done it,
 

259
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,310
done it. Since they've already done it,
the upside is all on the Democratic

260
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
the upside is all on the Democratic
 

261
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,790
the upside is all on the Democratic
side. Kathy Hokll should do the same

262
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
side. Kathy Hokll should do the same
 

263
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,830
side. Kathy Hokll should do the same
damn thing in New York. JB Pritsker

264
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
damn thing in New York. JB Pritsker
 

265
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,029
damn thing in New York. JB Pritsker
should do the same thing in Illinois.

266
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
should do the same thing in Illinois.
 

267
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,189
should do the same thing in Illinois.
And this can effectively end the Trump

268
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
And this can effectively end the Trump
 

269
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,670
And this can effectively end the Trump
presidency. We need people who will

270
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
presidency. We need people who will
 

271
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,070
presidency. We need people who will
fight. If we acknowledge that this

272
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
fight. If we acknowledge that this
 

273
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,029
fight. If we acknowledge that this
presidency is as dangerous as many of us

274
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
presidency is as dangerous as many of us
 

275
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,790
presidency is as dangerous as many of us
know it to be, why wouldn't we take any

276
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
know it to be, why wouldn't we take any
 

277
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,430
know it to be, why wouldn't we take any
legal means necessary or legal means

278
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
legal means necessary or legal means
 

279
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,790
legal means necessary or legal means
possible to just make it run into a

280
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
possible to just make it run into a
 

281
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,430
possible to just make it run into a
brick wall? So, if given the chance, I

282
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
brick wall? So, if given the chance, I
 

283
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,830
brick wall? So, if given the chance, I
would end all gerrymandering today. I

284
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
would end all gerrymandering today. I
 

285
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,310
would end all gerrymandering today. I
would end all of it right now. We're not

286
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,320
would end all of it right now. We're not
 

287
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,270
would end all of it right now. We're not
there and we have to find a way to stop

288
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
there and we have to find a way to stop
 

289
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,830
there and we have to find a way to stop
Trump. We've got something to fight for.

290
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
Trump. We've got something to fight for.
 

291
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,909
Trump. We've got something to fight for.
This is something if you want to donate

292
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
This is something if you want to donate
 

293
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,749
This is something if you want to donate
to the the uh redraw campaign for the

294
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
to the the uh redraw campaign for the
 

295
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,909
to the the uh redraw campaign for the
ballot referendum, then you can do it.

296
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
ballot referendum, then you can do it.
 

297
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,909
ballot referendum, then you can do it.
And now I want to talk about the bigger

298
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
And now I want to talk about the bigger
 

299
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,029
And now I want to talk about the bigger
strategy for Democrats. A pending

300
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
strategy for Democrats. A pending
 

301
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,590
strategy for Democrats. A pending
Supreme Court case could strip our

302
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
Supreme Court case could strip our
 

303
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,510
Supreme Court case could strip our
Fourth Amendment rights and allow

304
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
Fourth Amendment rights and allow
 

305
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,909
Fourth Amendment rights and allow
immigration agents to come into our

immigration agents to come into our
 

307
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,110
immigration agents to come into our
homes for any reason. No probable cause

homes for any reason. No probable cause
 

309
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,990
homes for any reason. No probable cause
needed. All while Republicans try to

310
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
